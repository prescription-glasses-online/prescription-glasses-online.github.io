Website Glitches & Absurd Returns: My BOGO Nightmare! ðŸ˜¤

Let me tell you about a terrible online shopping experience, hoping it serves as a warning. I was genuinely excited to get new glasses, but this company proved to be nothing short of dishonest. They don't honor promos, and it was impossible to collect an offer because their site is full of glitches. My simple solution for a BOGO offer that didn't apply was met with an absurd demand to return and reorder my perfectly fine glasses! This whole ordeal made me feel compelled to leave a review and engage with customer service, desperately seeking a fair resolution.
Customer: I'm really upset. I ordered two pairs of glasses expecting a BOGO deal, but your website glitched, and it didn't apply. Now you're telling me I have to return the glasses I just received, which are perfectly fine and the correct prescription, just to reorder them to get the promotion you messed up?
CS Rep: I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and frustration caused by the website glitch and the trouble with your BOGO promotion. That's definitely not the experience we want you to have.
Customer: But why can't you just credit the difference back to my card? It feels completely unprofessional to ask me to go through the hassle of returning and reordering for an error on your end. It's too easy, right?
CS Rep: I understand your frustration with that process, and I truly regret the workaround we initially offered. Let me see if I can manually apply the discount to your existing order or issue a partial refund for the BOGO difference, avoiding the return. Please bear with me while I check your order details.
Customer: Okay, that sounds much better. I really just want what was promised without more complications.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap of unhonored promotions and frustrating customer service.

My last online glasses purchase was a complete nightmare! ðŸ˜­ I was genuinely excited for a BOGO deal, but the website was plagued with glitches, preventing the promotion from applying.
