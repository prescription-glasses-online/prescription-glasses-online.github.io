Express Shipping Nightmare: Weeks of Wait & Non-Existent Customer Service! 😤💔

Let me tell you, my recent online shopping experience was nothing short of a nightmare, and I'm sharing this as a cautionary tale. I paid for express shipping on several pairs of glasses, only to feel completely ripped off! As I've concluded, don't bother paying for their faster shipping because you still have to wait a few weeks to get your glasses; it'll only get them to you about two days sooner – absolutely not worth that money. The customer service, in my experience, is among the worst I have ever experienced. I felt compelled to leave this review and attempt to engage their customer service because of the sheer frustration of this broken promise and the complete lack of accessible help.
Customer: I'm incredibly frustrated. I paid for express shipping, expecting my glasses in a few days, and it's been weeks! Why was I charged for a service I clearly didn't receive, and why is it impossible to get a real person on the chat or email?
CS Rep: I sincerely apologize for the significant delay with your express shipping and the difficulties you've faced reaching us. That's certainly not the experience we want for our customers. I can confirm your express shipping fee will be refunded immediately.
Customer: A refund is a start, but I'm still without my glasses after paying extra for speed. This whole process has been incredibly disappointing. The customer service has been the worst I've ever experienced.
CS Rep: I completely understand your disappointment, and I am truly sorry for the poor service and the extended wait. I've processed that shipping refund, and I'll personally look into your order's current status right now to provide you with an exact delivery update.
Customer: Just get me my glasses and make sure this refund actually goes through. I just want this nightmare to be over.
CS Rep: I assure you, the refund will be processed promptly, and I'll keep you updated on your delivery. Thank you for your patience as we work to resolve this for you.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

My last online shopping experience was an absolute nightmare 😭. I paid for express shipping on several pairs of glasses, only to feel completely ripped off! It took weeks to get them, just two days faster than standard, and their customer service was non-existent. Trying to get a real person on chat or email was impossible – talk about a broken promise and a complete lack of accessible help! I was so frustrated 😤.
After that horrible ordeal, I was incredibly hesitant to buy glasses online again 🤔, but I desperately needed a new pair and hoped to find a truly reliable place. That's when I stumbled upon cinily.net. I decided to give them a try, crossing my fingers for a better experience. I had read reviews like, "very customer friendly and the prices are amazing plus the discounts," which gave me hope.
And boy, am I glad I did! From start to finish, my experience with cinily.net has been fantastic ✨. The selection of frames is impressive, and the quality of the glasses far exceeded my expectations. What truly sets them apart is their incredible customer service; they are responsive and genuinely helpful, a stark contrast to my previous nightmare! The value for money is unbeatable – it’s easy to find cheap prescription glasses online without compromising on quality. The ordering process was smooth, and my glasses arrived much faster than expected. I'm genuinely happy with my purchase and finally feel like I got what I paid for! 😃
