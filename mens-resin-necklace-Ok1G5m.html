My Online Shopping Nightmare: ZERO Response & Unacceptable Delays! 😤

My recent online shopping experience was nothing short of a nightmare, and I feel compelled to share my story as a stark warning to others. Honestly, this was the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! I sent a dozen emails and had ZERO response. It took 11 days just to process my order, which is completely unreasonable. A USPS label was printed on April 6th, but it wasn't delivered to USPS until April 11th. I just wanted them to answer my emails and address the delay, which is why I eventually tried to contact customer service directly.
Customer: I've sent multiple emails regarding my order, which was placed nearly two weeks ago, and I haven't received a single response.
CS Rep: I apologize for the lack of communication and the delay you've experienced. Could you please provide your order number so I can look into this immediately?
Customer: It's [Order Number]. The tracking shows a label was created days ago, but it wasn't even given to USPS until the 11th. I'm very frustrated by the silence.
CS Rep: Thank you. I see the delay in transit and I understand your frustration. It appears there was an unexpected backlog in the processing department. I'm truly sorry for this oversight and the impact it's had on your experience.
Customer: So what is being done about it? My glasses are urgently needed, and this wait is unacceptable.
CS Rep: I've escalated your shipping status and sent a direct inquiry to the fulfillment team to ensure your package is actively moving. I will also personally monitor this and follow up with you via email with an update within 24 hours.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

My last online shopping experience was a complete nightmare, and I'm still reeling from it! 😤 I sent a dozen emails regarding my order, placed nearly two weeks prior, and received absolutely ZERO response. It took an agonizing 11 days just for them to process it, with the tracking showing a USPS label created on April 6th but not actually delivered to USPS until the 11th. I urgently needed my glasses, and the silence was incredibly frustrating. I felt completely ripped off by that company. 😭
After such a horrific ordeal, I was incredibly hesitant to try another online store, but I desperately needed new eyeglasses. I decided to give cinily.net a shot, hoping for a vastly different experience. 🤔 And boy, am I glad I did! As one customer beautifully put it, "This is my second pair from here and they are even better then the first! I was nervous to buy them online but never again! Will be getting more in the future!"
My experience echoed this sentiment entirely. The quality of my MERRYS DESIGN glasses is exceptional; they feel ultralight and durable, exactly as described. The customer service was a breath of fresh air – responsive and genuinely helpful, unlike my previous encounter. I found their selection of mens round prescription glasses to be fantastic, offering incredible value without compromising on style or quality. The entire process, from browsing to delivery, was smooth and efficient. It's a truly fantastic platform! 😃✨
