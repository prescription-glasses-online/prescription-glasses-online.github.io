Online Shopping Nightmare: 2.5 Hours Wasted on a Broken Website! 😤

I need to share my terrible online shopping experience as a warning. My purchase process was a complete nightmare. The website was so messed up it took me 2-1/2 hours just to try and buy two pairs of glasses! I couldn't even type in my prescription and save it to continue my purchase, which meant I'd have to wait for an email to input the same information again. This entire process was so incredibly frustrating and felt like a huge waste of my time. I felt compelled to leave this review and reach out to customer service because I don't want anyone else to go through this avoidable hassle.
Customer: Hello, I'm calling about an order I just tried to place. Your website is absolutely impossible to use.
CS Rep: I apologize for the trouble you experienced. Could you please describe what happened?
Customer: I spent two and a half hours trying to purchase two pairs of glasses, and I couldn't even enter my prescription properly. It wouldn't save, and now I'm told I have to wait for an email to input everything again! This is incredibly frustrating.
CS Rep: I truly understand your frustration. That sounds like a very difficult experience, and I'm very sorry our website caused such an inconvenience. Let me see if I can help you complete your order now and bypass that email step.
Customer: Can you actually do that? Because after all that wasted time, I'm not sure I even want to try again through your site. This whole process has been a total waste of my time.
CS Rep: Yes, I can certainly assist you. Please allow me a moment to pull up your attempt, and we can input the prescription details directly over the phone and ensure your order goes through smoothly this time. I want to make sure we resolve this for you.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap of a frustrating, time-consuming online order process.

My last online shopping experience for glasses was an absolute nightmare 😤. I spent two and a half hours trying to purchase two pairs, only for the website to glitch and not save my prescription. I had to wait for an email to re-enter everything, which felt like an incredible waste of my time. The frustration was immense, and I almost gave up on buying glasses online altogether 😭.
But then, after hearing some good things, I decided to give cinily.net a try. I was really hesitant, but my previous experience made me crave a smooth and reliable process 🤔. And wow, what a difference!
Someone else also said: "Awesome site! Your one stop shop for eyewear. I ordered one pair last month and have already ordered another this month. Easy site to use and fast shipping. Will be a customer for a long time."
My experience was just as fantastic! From the moment I landed on their site, everything was clear and easy. I found the Vintage Optical Glasses Frame OV5183 O'malley Eyeglasses, which are exactly what I was looking for ✨. The process of entering my details and prescription was seamless, a stark contrast to my previous ordeal. Their range of prescription glasses is impressive, and the quality of the frames I received is excellent. The customer service, though I barely needed it, was friendly and efficient when I had a quick question about shipping. Cinily.net has definitely restored my faith in online eyewear shopping. Highly recommend! 😃
