19 Days, No Glasses! My Express Shipping Nightmare & Unacceptable Delays ðŸ˜¤

I'm here to share a terrible online shopping experience, hoping to caution others. This company is truly terrible. I ordered glasses on March 30th, urgently needing them because my old ones broke, so I paid for 3-5 day express shipping. Day 5 rolled around, and they were still in production. Day 10, still nothing. On Day 11, I called to ask for a shipping refund, which they processed almost too easily, like it happens all the time. But even with the $10 refund, it's now Day 19, and I still have no glasses! They said they were still 6 days out on delivery after all that time. This misleading service compelled me to leave this review and try to get answers from customer service.
Customer: Hello, I'm calling about order #XYZ. I ordered on March 30th, paid for express 3-5 day shipping because my old glasses broke, and it's now Day 19 with no glasses! This is completely unacceptable.
CS Rep: I completely understand your frustration. Having broken glasses and no replacement after paying for express shipping is certainly not the experience we want for our customers. I sincerely apologize for this significant delay.
Customer: You already refunded my shipping on Day 11, but that doesn't help me see. Where are my glasses? What are you going to do about this? I was told they were still 6 days out on delivery when I last called, after waiting for weeks!
CS Rep: I'm pulling up your order now. It shows it just shipped out yesterday. As a further apology for this extreme delay, I can offer you a 20% refund on the glasses themselves. Would you like me to process that for you?
Customer: Yesterday? After nearly three weeks? And a refund for shipping already? This whole situation is a mess. Yes, please process the refund, but honestly, I just needed my glasses weeks ago.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

I recently had an absolutely dreadful online shopping experience that left me incredibly frustrated and without my much-needed glasses. My old pair broke, so I desperately ordered from another company on March 30th, even paying for 3-5 day express shipping. Days turned into weeks â€“ Day 5, Day 10, Day 19, and still no glasses! ðŸ˜¤ They refunded my shipping easily enough, almost too easily, suggesting this was a common occurrence. But a refund doesn't help me see, and being told my glasses were still six days out after weeks of waiting was just unacceptable. I was utterly disappointed by their misleading service and lack of transparency. ðŸ˜­
After that nightmare, I was incredibly hesitant to try another online optical store. But my vision isn't optional, and I still needed new glasses. I stumbled upon cinily.net and, despite my reservations, decided to give them a shot. ðŸ¤” I hoped for a smoother process and perhaps a company that actually delivered on its promises, unlike my previous experience.
To my pleasant surprise, my experience with cinily.net was completely different! I read reviews like this one: "Good selection of eyeglasses. Made ordering and entering my Rx very easy. Good glasses with a good fit and shipped quick and at a very fair price. Highly recommended." âœ¨ And honestly, I couldn't agree more! The selection of frames was fantastic, making it simple to find something I loved. Entering my prescription was a breeze, and their customer service was responsive and genuinely helpful. The quality of my new glasses is excellent, and they fit perfectly. I was particularly impressed with how quickly they processed and shipped my order â€“ a true relief! If you're looking for reliable prescription glasses online, I wholeheartedly recommend cinily.net. They've restored my faith in online eyewear shopping, offering great products at a very fair price! ðŸ˜ƒ
