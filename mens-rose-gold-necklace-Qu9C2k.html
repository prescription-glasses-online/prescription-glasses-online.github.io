Next-Day Delivery Nightmare: My $19.95 Shipping Scam & Automated Customer Service Hell! ðŸ˜¤

Let me tell you, my latest online shopping experience was nothing short of a nightmare, and I'm sharing this as a cautionary tale for anyone considering using this company. I fell for their promise of "next day delivery," only to be ripped off for the express shipping fee. Hours after paying, I got an email saying my order would take three business days. It feels like a complete fraud, charging for services they clearly do not provide. I felt compelled to leave this review and engage with customer service because their business is nothing more than an automated mess that cares nothing about its customers.
Customer: I paid for "next day delivery" and received an email saying my order will take three business days to process. This is unacceptable, and I want my $19.95 shipping fee refunded immediately.
CS Rep: I apologize for the confusion regarding our shipping times. While we offer expedited shipping, the "next day" refers to the transit time after the order has been processed and shipped. I understand your frustration with this discrepancy.
Customer: That's not what "next day delivery" implies on your site! It's misleading. I paid for next-day service, and I didn't get it. I've tried reaching out by email and your chat bot, but I can't get a human response. I need that refund processed now.
CS Rep: I truly regret the difficulty you've experienced in reaching us and the misleading impression about the delivery timeframe. I can certainly submit a refund request for the $19.95 shipping fee to our billing department right away. It typically takes 7-10 business days to process.
Customer: So, I have to wait even longer for my money back after being misled? This entire process, from your false promises to your inaccessible customer service, is simply horrible. Just make sure that refund comes through.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

My last online shopping experience was an absolute nightmare ðŸ˜¤. I was completely misled by a company that promised "next day delivery" but then charged me for express shipping only to tell me hours later that my order would take three business days to process. It felt like a total rip-off and a scam, with their customer service being an automated black hole that offered no real help ðŸ˜­. I was so frustrated and vowed never to fall for such false promises again.
After that terrible ordeal, I was really hesitant to try another online eyewear store ðŸ¤”. But I desperately needed new glasses, and a friend recommended cinily.net, mentioning their transparent policies and great reviews. I decided to give them a shot, hoping for a smoother process.
I'm so glad I did! âœ¨ The shopping experience was fantastic. Everything was just as ordered, and I appreciate how easy the process seems if I ever need an exchange for something like sunglasses. They offer truly affordable prescription glasses without compromising on style or clarity. My experience with their customer service was also a breath of fresh air; quick, helpful, and human â€“ a stark contrast to my previous nightmare! Cinily.net has definitely earned my trust and future business.
