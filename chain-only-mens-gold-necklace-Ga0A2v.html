Website Nightmare: 2.5 Hours Lost & Prescription Problems 😡

Let me tell you, my online shopping experience recently was an absolute nightmare, and I feel compelled to share it as a cautionary tale. Trying to buy glasses should be straightforward, but with this company, it was anything but. The website was so messed up it took me 2-1/2 hours to purchase two pairs of glasses. I wasn't able to type in my prescription and save it to continue my purchase, which meant I'll have to be sent an email just so I can re-type the information I already put into their silly web site! This entire process was so very frustrating and certainly a waste of my precious time. I'm not even sure I'll attempt to order from them ever again. This awful experience is why I picked up the phone to talk to customer service.
Customer: Hi, I'm calling because I've just spent over two hours trying to order glasses on your website, and it's been incredibly frustrating. The site kept glitching, and I couldn't save my prescription.
CS Rep: I am so sorry to hear you've had such a difficult experience with our website. That sounds incredibly frustrating, and I sincerely apologize for the trouble you've encountered. Can you please tell me more about what happened with saving your prescription?
Customer: I filled it all out, clicked save, and nothing happened. It just wouldn't register, so I couldn't move forward with my order without getting an email to re-enter it, which feels completely redundant after all the time I already spent.
CS Rep: I completely understand why that would be frustrating, especially after dedicating so much time to your purchase. We've had some reports of intermittent issues with prescription saving, and our IT team is actively working on it.
Customer: So, what does that mean for my order now? Do I still have to wait for an email and go through all that again? I just want to complete my purchase without this hassle.
CS Rep: Let me try to help you right now. I can manually create your order on our end and input your prescription directly from the information you provide me. Would you be comfortable sharing your prescription details with me over the phone so we can bypass the website issue and get your order finalized?
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap and wasting their valuable time.
