<h3>My 'Super Hydrophobic' Lenses Were a Smudged Nightmare & Customer Service Was Worse ðŸ˜­</h3>
<p></br>
I'm sharing my terrible online shopping experience as a cautionary tale. I shelled out an extra $48 for the Super Hydrophobic coating on my premium lenses, expecting crystal clear vision, but these lenses are nearly impossible to clean. This isn't a user issue; I've worn glasses for 60 years and have 9 pairs from Zenni without this problem. My inability to render the glasses smudge-less is clearly a defect. I felt compelled to leave this review and engage with customer service because after paying for a superior product, I'm left with something unusable, and their warranty process has been incredibly frustrating.</p>
<p>Customer: I'm calling about my recent order, #105180754. I paid extra for the Super Hydrophobic coating, but the lenses are impossible to keep clean. They're constantly smudged, and it's clearly a defect.
CS Rep: I understand how frustrating it must be to have difficulty cleaning your new glasses, especially after investing in a premium coating. We apologize for this inconvenience.
Customer: Inconvenience? I just want a replacement pair with the Super Hydrophobic treatment applied correctly. Your chat agent only offered a 50% store credit, which is unacceptable for a defective product still under warranty.
CS Rep: I hear your concern, and I understand you believe the issue is a defect with the coating application. We need our review team to assess this, which typically takes 3 to 5 business days for an email response. I'll ensure your request for a full replacement is escalated for their priority review.
Customer: So I just wait? I still don't have clean glasses, and I can't even speak to someone directly by phone to sort this out faster. This whole process is dragging on.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap of unfulfilled promises and frustrating customer service.

<h3>After a Lens Disaster, I Found My Perfect Pair at Cinily.net! âœ¨</h3>

My last online glasses purchase was a total nightmare ðŸ˜¤. I paid extra for a "Super Hydrophobic coating" on premium lenses from another site, expecting crystal clear vision, but they were impossible to clean! It wasn't user error; I've worn glasses for 60 years. Dealing with their customer service and a frustrating warranty process for a clearly defective product was incredibly disappointing ðŸ˜­. I was offered a measly 50% store credit for a faulty product, and waiting days for an email response felt like an eternity.</p>
<p>After that dreadful experience, I was hesitant to try another online eyewear store. But my old glasses were on their last legs, and I really needed a reliable place to find quality eyewear. I decided to give cinily.net a shot, hoping for a better experience this time ðŸ¤”.</p>
<p>I saw reviews like this one: "I love this site. I have used them for years for my glasses and sunglasses. And I refer my friends and family to them. The price is right, they have all the extras I want and the customer service has been great." And I totally agree! From the moment I started browsing, everything felt different. The selection of frames was fantastic, and the ordering process was so smooth and intuitive.</p>
<p>My new Pink Blue Light Glasses arrived quickly, and the quality is exceptional âœ¨. They are incredibly comfortable, and the blue light filtering works wonders. Most importantly, they are easy to clean â€“ a stark contrast to my previous nightmare! The customer service was also responsive and genuinely helpful when I had a minor query. It's truly refreshing to find a place that offers such <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=142">affordable prescription glasses</a> without compromising on quality or service. I'm genuinely thrilled with my purchase from cinily.net ðŸ˜ƒ.</p>
