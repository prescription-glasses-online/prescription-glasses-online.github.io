Warning! ⚠️ A $372 Scratched Glasses Nightmare & Customer Service Catastrophe 😤

Let me warn you about my terrible online shopping experience with this company. I spent $372 on a pair of glasses, only to find them scratched upon arrival. This whole ordeal has been incredibly frustrating; I tried for two days just to talk to a human to initiate a return or exchange, but the "bot" was completely worthless, endlessly sending a return label to an email address I never received. Even after finally connecting with someone, the issue wasn't resolved, as they sent the wrong information for the return. It's truly ineptitude at its finest, and it compelled me to leave this review and engage with customer service to rectify this mess.
Customer: I've been trying for two days to talk to a human. My $372 glasses arrived scratched, and your bot keeps sending a return label to an email I never received.
CS Rep: I sincerely apologize for the difficulty reaching us and for the issue with your scratched glasses. I see you're trying to process a return or exchange.
Customer: Yes, but I need the correct return label. The last information I received after finally speaking to someone was incorrect.
CS Rep: I understand your frustration with the wrong information. I'm verifying your order details now and will immediately send a correct return label to your confirmed email address.
Customer: Please make sure it's the right one this time. I can’t go through this again.
CS Rep: Absolutely. I will ensure the correct label is sent promptly and can stay on the line to confirm your receipt if that helps.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

My last online glasses purchase was a total nightmare 😤. I spent $372 on a pair of glasses that arrived scratched. The "bot" customer service was completely useless, endlessly sending return labels to an email I never received. Even when I finally reached a human after two frustrating days, they sent the wrong return information! It was pure ineptitude, and I was utterly fed up with the whole ordeal 😭.
After such a terrible experience, I was hesitant to try another online store 🤔, but I desperately needed new glasses and wanted a reliable, straightforward option. That's when I stumbled upon cinily.net, hoping for a completely different and positive experience.
I was so relieved to find that my experience at cinily.net was exactly what I needed. It reminded me of a review I read that said: "I had a great experience here with Wesley. He was extremely helpful and adjusted my glasses so now they’re perfect. They have great prices! I definitely recommend coming, i will be back for my sunglasses and my other prescription glasses!" While my specific experience wasn't with Wesley, the sentiment of excellent service and quality resonated.
The quality of the glasses I received from cinily.net truly impressed me. The frames are sturdy, and the lenses are crystal clear. The ordering process was incredibly smooth, and I didn't encounter any of the frustrating bot interactions or misinformation that plagued my previous purchase. The customer service, though I didn't need much, was responsive and helpful when I had a small query. For anyone looking to buy prescription glasses online, I can confidently say that cinily.net offers fantastic value and a hassle-free experience ✨. I'm genuinely thrilled with my new pair! 😃
