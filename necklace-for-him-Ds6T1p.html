Warning! ‚ö†Ô∏è A $372 Scratched Glasses Nightmare & Customer Service Catastrophe üò§

Let me warn you about my terrible online shopping experience with this company. I spent $372 on a pair of glasses, only to find them scratched upon arrival. This whole ordeal has been incredibly frustrating; I tried for two days just to talk to a human to initiate a return or exchange, but the "bot" was completely worthless, endlessly sending a return label to an email address I never received. Even after finally connecting with someone, the issue wasn't resolved, as they sent the wrong information for the return. It's truly ineptitude at its finest, and it compelled me to leave this review and engage with customer service to rectify this mess.
Customer: I've been trying for two days to talk to a human. My $372 glasses arrived scratched, and your bot keeps sending a return label to an email I never received.
CS Rep: I sincerely apologize for the difficulty reaching us and for the issue with your scratched glasses. I see you're trying to process a return or exchange.
Customer: Yes, but I need the correct return label. The last information I received after finally speaking to someone was incorrect.
CS Rep: I understand your frustration with the wrong information. I'm verifying your order details now and will immediately send a correct return label to your confirmed email address.
Customer: Please make sure it's the right one this time. I can‚Äôt go through this again.
CS Rep: Absolutely. I will ensure the correct label is sent promptly and can stay on the line to confirm your receipt if that helps.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

He was extremely helpful and adjusted my glasses so now they‚Äôre perfect. They have great prices! I definitely recommend coming, i will be back for my sunglasses and my other prescription glasses!" While my specific experience wasn't with Wesley, the sentiment of excellent service and quality resonated.
