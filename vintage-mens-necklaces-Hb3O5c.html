Warning! My $372 Scratched Glasses Ordeal & Customer Service Nightmare! ðŸ˜¡

I'm writing this review as a warning to anyone considering shopping here. My experience has been an absolute nightmare, and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. I spent $372 on scratched glasses, and what followed was pure 'ineptitude at its finest.' I've been trying for two days just to talk to a human to fix this issue, with no luck. The bot just kept sending the return label to an email I never received, and even after finally talking to someone, they sent the wrong information for the return. This whole ordeal has been so frustrating, and frankly, my lawyers will have a field day with this if it doesn't get resolved. I felt compelled to share my story and engage with customer service in hopes of fixing this mess, but also to caution others about what can happen.
Customer: Hello, I'm calling because I'm incredibly frustrated. I spent $372 on glasses that arrived scratched, and I've been trying for two days just to get a return label or speak to someone. The bot keeps sending it to an email I never received.
CS Rep: I'm so sorry to hear about the scratched glasses and the trouble you've had reaching us and getting the return label. That sounds incredibly frustrating. Let me pull up your order details. Can you please confirm the email address on file and your order number?
Customer: Yes, it's [email address] and order number [order number]. And honestly, even after finally talking to someone, they sent the wrong information for the return. This whole process has been a mess.
CS Rep: Thank you for confirming. I see the previous attempt to send the label and an incorrect return instruction. My apologies for that error. I'm going to resend the correct return label and detailed instructions to your confirmed email right now. I'll also stay on the line to confirm you receive it this time, and we can discuss setting up a replacement or refund once the return is processed.
Customer: Okay, please make sure it's the right one this time. This has taken far too much of my time and effort.
CS Rep: Absolutely. I understand your frustration, and I assure you I'm doing everything I can to get this resolved correctly for you today. The email should arrive within a minute. Please let me know when you see it.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

Trust me, your eyes will thank you!

I'm still reeling from my last online glasses purchase. It was an absolute nightmare! ðŸ˜¤ I spent $372 on glasses that arrived scratched, and the customer service was pure 'ineptitude at its finest.' Trying to get a return label or speak to a human was impossible â€“ the bot just kept sending it to an email I never received. Even when I finally talked to someone, they sent the wrong return information. The whole ordeal was incredibly frustrating, and honestly, I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy! ðŸ˜­
After that horrendous experience, I was really hesitant to try buying glasses online again. But my prescription had changed, and I desperately needed new glasses. I saw an ad for cinily.net and thought, "Maybe this time will be different?" ðŸ¤” I was desperate for a smooth, hassle-free experience, unlike my last one.
Before committing, I looked at their reviews, and I found one that really resonated: "As usual, top notch service and great glasses! Love them :)" This gave me a glimmer of hope that cinily.net could actually deliver.
And they absolutely did! From browsing their extensive collection of cat eye prescription glasses to the incredibly smooth checkout process, everything was a breath of fresh air. My new glasses arrived quickly, and the quality is outstanding â€“ crystal clear lenses and sturdy frames. ðŸ¤© Their customer service is responsive and genuinely helpful, a stark contrast to my previous ordeal. The prices are fantastic for such high quality, making it truly unbeatable value. This experience has completely restored my faith in online eyewear shopping. Thank you, cinily.net! âœ¨
