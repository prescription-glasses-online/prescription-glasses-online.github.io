GlassesUSA Warning: The Pupil Distance Trap & Customer Service Nightmare! ðŸ˜ 

Let me share a truly terrible online shopping experience, hoping it serves as a cautionary tale for anyone considering GlassesUSA. My child needed glasses, and we thought we found the perfect pair using their virtual try-on. But when they arrived, my 12-year-old couldn't see properly. We quickly learned the pupil distance (PD) was incorrect. It turns out, the GlassesUSA site doesn't prompt you for this crucial number, and they just assume a value, which means it will be wrong for many buyers. This forced me to try and reach their customer service, a truly frustrating endeavor, as you can never seem to reach a human, and email interactions are painfully slow. I felt compelled to leave this review because the entire process, from incorrect order to trying to get it fixed, was a nightmare.
Customer: I'm calling about an order for my son's glasses. He can't see properly with them because the pupil distance is completely wrong. Your website didn't even prompt me for this vital information!
CS Rep: I understand your frustration, sir/madam. I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused your son. We do have a feature for customers to enter their PD, but if it's not provided, we use a standard measurement. Let me look up your order and see how we can correct this for you.
Customer: Standard measurement? That's unacceptable for prescription glasses! And frankly, trying to get through to someone has been an ordeal. My son needs these glasses. What's the process for getting correct lenses, and how quickly can this be resolved?
CS Rep: You're absolutely right to be concerned. We truly apologize for the difficulty reaching us. To correct the PD, we'll need the accurate measurement. Once we have it, we can arrange for new lenses to be made and shipped. We aim to expedite this process for you.
Customer: So, I have to send these back first, and then wait again without any glasses for my son? This is just dragging on. Can't you do something quicker given this was an error on your end with the assumed PD?
CS Rep: I understand that's not ideal, and I apologize for the wait. Unfortunately, our exchange policy does require the original item to be returned before the replacement can be processed. However, I can ensure this exchange is marked as a priority once we receive the return. Would you like me to guide you through generating a return label?
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

My last online glasses purchase was a total nightmare ðŸ˜¤.
