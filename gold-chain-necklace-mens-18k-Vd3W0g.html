My Two-Day Customer Service Nightmare: $372 Scratched Glasses & Bot/Human Failures üò§

This has been a truly terrible online shopping experience, and I feel compelled to share my story as a cautionary tale. I can't believe the ordeal I've gone through trying to resolve an issue, and it perfectly encapsulates why I'm so frustrated: "UPDATE: Issue still not resolved. After FINALLY TALKING TO A HUMAN, THEY SENT THE WRONG INFORMATION FOR THE RETURN. Ineptitude at its finest. My lawyers will have a field day with this if it does not get resolved. Been trying for 2 days to TALK TO A HUMAN to fix an issue‚Ä¶no luck. Will NOT be buying from them again. Spent $372 on SCRATCHED glasses and tried to start a return/exchange. Never received the return label and the ‚Äúbot‚Äù just continues to send it to my email, that I never received! Lawyers will be contacted in order to rectify this. No more business from me." I felt I had no choice but to try and speak to someone, hoping they could understand my exasperation.
Customer: I've been trying for two days to get a return label for my scratched glasses. I spent $372, and they arrived damaged! Your bot keeps sending the label to an email I'm not receiving, and now the human I finally spoke to sent the wrong information!
CS Rep: I sincerely apologize for the incredible frustration and inconvenience you've experienced, especially with receiving scratched glasses and the ongoing issues with your return. That is completely unacceptable. Can you please provide your order number so I can look into this immediately?
Customer: My order number is [Customer provides order number]. I need a correct return label sent to the right email address, and I want assurance this will be handled properly this time. I‚Äôm losing patience.
CS Rep: Thank you for that. I see the previous attempts to send the label. I am creating a new return label for you right now and will personally ensure it's sent to the correct email address on file. I'll also follow up to confirm you receive it and initiate the exchange process for a new, flawless pair.
Customer: This better work. I've already wasted so much time.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

My last online shopping experience was a total nightmare, and I'm still reeling from it üò§. I spent $372 on scratched glasses that arrived damaged. Trying to get a return label was an endless loop of frustration, with a bot sending emails I never received. When I finally spoke to a human, they sent the wrong information! Two days wasted, and still no resolution. My patience was completely gone, and I swore I‚Äôd never shop for glasses online again üò≠.
