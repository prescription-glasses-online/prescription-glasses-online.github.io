My old glasses were worn out, scratched, and frankly, I was tired of their dated look. ðŸ˜©ðŸ‘“âœ¨

It was early 2024, and I found myself in that familiar predicament: my old glasses were worn out, scratched, and frankly, I was tired of their dated look. I needed a refresh, something stylish yet functional, and the thought of navigating crowded optical stores filled me with dread. That's when the idea of ordering glasses online really appealed to me. I'd seen countless ads for online eyewear retailers, promising convenience and affordability. My main pain point was always the time commitment and the pressure to choose quickly in a physical store. I just wanted to browse at my own pace from the comfort of my home, finding that perfect pair that truly spoke to my style. The virtual try-on features seemed like a dream come true, offering a glimpse of how new frames might look without stepping foot outside. I was hoping for a seamless experience that would deliver both convenience and a fantastic new look, something many online shoppers rave about.
My search for the perfect online eyewear store led me to Cinily Eyewear. Their website looked slick, and they had an impressive selection. I spent hours virtually trying on different styles, and eventually, my eyes landed on the Merry's S2053 Cat Eye Glasses. They were exactly the chic, modern look I was going for. The purchasing process itself was mostly straightforward â€“ selecting the frame, indicating prescription type, and choosing lens packages. However, I did hit a snag when it came to the pupil distance (PD). The site didn't prominently prompt for it, and as someone who usually relies on the optician for that measurement, I just assumed they had a standard method or would confirm with me. This oversight, as I would soon discover, is a common issue. I remember seeing a comment from another customer, Steve Greenbaum, who experienced something very similar: "The Cinily Eyewear site does not prompt you to provide the PD number, and if you donâ€™t know to provide it, they will just assume a value of 62 (adult) or another value for kids. Of course, that means the value will be wrong for many buyers." This resonated deeply with my later experience. Despite this slight worry, I completed my order, excited for my new frames to arrive.
The anticipation waiting for my new glasses was immense. When the package finally arrived in early 2025, it was neatly packed, providing adequate protection for the frames. Unboxing felt satisfying; the frames themselves, the Merry's S2053 Cat Eye Glasses, had a sleek, polished look, and the brown-silver combination was even more striking in person. The cat-eye shape was flattering, and the material felt robust, not flimsy like some cheaper online options. Visually, they perfectly matched the images online, and the initial feel was quite positive. I quickly put them on, eager to experience my new world through them.
However, the initial excitement quickly turned into concern. While the frames fit well and looked great, the vision through the lenses wasâ€¦ off. Things felt slightly blurry, and I found myself constantly adjusting them, trying to find a clear spot. It was frustrating, and I immediately suspected the PD issue I had briefly worried about during the ordering process. My experience mirrored exactly what Steve Greenbaum described: "We ordered a pair of glasses for our 12-year-old after he found them using the virtual try-on, but he said he had trouble seeing with them. We went back to the doctor to check everything, and he informed us that the pupil distance (PD) was incorrect." This realization confirmed my fears. Reaching out to customer service proved to be a test of patience. "Please know you will never be able to reach a human at Cinily Eyewear and have a real phone conversation if you call them, so plan on frustration if your glasses are not correct. Email interactions are too slow, causing the process to drag on." This statement from Steve was spot on. Emails took days for a response, and each interaction felt like starting the conversation from scratch. The process of getting corrected lenses was arduous; I had to send my original pair back first, meaning I was without any glasses for a significant period while I waited for the replacement. Thankfully, once the corrected lenses arrived â€“ after much back and forth â€“ the difference was night and day. The clarity was perfect, and the frames, finally, felt like a true extension of myself. The sleek design of the Merry's S2053 Cat Eye Glasses, now with the correct prescription, was a joy to wear daily. They felt lightweight and comfortable for long hours, whether I was working on my computer or out and about.
Overall, my experience with Cinily Eyewear was a mixed bag. The product itself, the Merry's S2053 Cat Eye Glasses, once corrected, is absolutely fantastic â€“ stylish, comfortable, and provides crystal-clear vision. They are truly great quality for the price. However, the initial journey to get to that perfect pair was unnecessarily challenging due to the lack of clear PD prompts and the frustratingly slow customer service. As Steve Greenbaum concluded, "The glasses, once remade, are working out well for us." This perfectly encapsulates my sentiment. I would recommend Cinily Eyewear for those who are confident in their PD measurement, or who are prepared for potentially slow customer service if an issue arises. If you're looking for fashionable, affordable frames and have accurate prescription details, especially your PD, already in hand, then these glasses could be a great choice for you. But be prepared to be proactive and patient if something isn't quite right from the start.
