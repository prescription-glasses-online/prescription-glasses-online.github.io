My journey to finding the perfect pair of glasses has always been a bit of a quest. üëì‚ú®

My journey to finding the perfect pair of glasses has always been a bit of a quest. As someone who spends countless hours staring at screens, whether for work or leisure, eye strain is a constant battle. My old frames were flimsy, constantly slipping down my nose, and frankly, they just didn't reflect my style. I yearned for something that blended classic aesthetics with modern comfort and durability, something that could carry me through long workdays and still look sharp during social outings. I‚Äôd been seeing a lot of sleek, retro-inspired designs online lately, and they really caught my eye. My main pain points were durability and finding a frame that truly felt like me ‚Äì a blend of professional and effortlessly cool. I needed a significant upgrade, not just in looks, but in overall quality and the ability to accommodate my prescription without feeling bulky. The idea of a stylish, yet robust frame that could handle daily wear and tear without breaking the bank was the ultimate goal.
When it came to actually purchasing, the online route seemed the most convenient. I browsed several sites, comparing prices, styles, and customer reviews. What ultimately drew me to Cinily Eyewear was their impressive selection of vintage-inspired frames, particularly the Thom TB101 Retro Round Glasses. The silver finish and classic round shape looked incredibly appealing. However, the ordering process wasn't entirely smooth sailing, and I found myself echoing some sentiments I'd later discover in other customer feedback. I chose standard shipping, but even then, there was a moment of concern when tracking updates felt a bit slow. Reading a comment from Michael Oakes, I truly empathized with their experience: "This place is nothing more than an automated business that cares nothing about its customers. They are a fraud, ripping customers off for services that they charge for and do NOT provide. I ordered twice from them before, without any need to return or exchange, so I never understood the negative reviews. The third time I ordered, their site said ‚Äúeligible for next day delivery‚Äù. That would typically mean ‚Äúnext day‚Äù, right? So, I pay for the $19.95 next day delivery fee, pay for my glasses and hours later receive an email stating that ‚Äúmy order is in process and will take 3 business days‚Äù. Where is next day? Wait‚Ä¶it doesn‚Äôt stop there. I call their toll free line‚Ä¶automated‚Ä¶no human intervention. I try their ‚Äúlive chat‚Äù‚Ä¶automated bot. I email both their customer service and returns department asking for a refund of my $19.95 next day delivery fee since it‚Äôs clearly not meeting the requirements‚Ä¶crickets. I call their toll free number back and keep going through the menu and trying different options. I try the one that asks if I want to place an order‚Ä¶bingo, I get a human. So I propose my issue to that person and after several moments on hold I get told ‚ÄúI will submit your request to the billing department and it will be up to them‚Äù. Ummm, nope‚Ä¶you‚Äôre not providing a service that I paid for‚Ä¶refund my money. Agent wasn‚Äôt hearing that and ended the call. Horrible business. Horrible customer service. Everything is automated and forces you to interact with a live chat bot or an endless phone system that they hope you‚Äôll just give up on from pure frustration. I will NEVER do business with this place again and will spread this review like the plague. Update 02-24-2025: Order placed 02-18, Label created 02-20 (not shipped as they stated), UPS in possession of package 02-21, Item in transit 02-22, Item delivered 02-24. Not ‚Äúnext day delivery‚Äù as their site clearly stated. Nothing to ‚Äúproduce‚Äù as the glasses had ‚ÄúPlano lenses‚Äù with no prescription so still not sure of the delay in ‚Äúproduction‚Äù. Still would not recommend this company based on their lack of replies to 6 emails requesting help. Their sugar coated response is lack luster and a poor attempt to cover up their extremely lacking customer service. Purchase elsewhere and avoid the issues that so many are having with this company." While my experience wasn't quite as dire, the feeling of a somewhat opaque system resonated. I ordered my glasses in early 2024, and though they arrived eventually, the tracking updates were sparse, leading to a few days of uncertainty.
Despite the minor hiccup with shipping communication, the moment my package from Cinily Eyewear finally arrived in late February 2024, my anticipation turned into genuine delight. The packaging was simple yet secure, with the glasses nestled safely in a sturdy case, which was a nice touch. Unboxing them felt like opening a little treasure chest. The Thom TB101 Retro Round Glasses themselves were even more striking in person. The silver frame gleamed, and the craftsmanship felt solid and premium, far exceeding what I expected for the price point. The subtle weight of the metal instantly conveyed durability, a stark contrast to my previous flimsy pair. The retro design was spot on, looking both sophisticated and stylish without being overly trendy. They truly felt like a statement piece.
Now, after several weeks of daily wear in mid-2024, I can confidently say these Thom TB101 frames have become an indispensable part of my routine. The build quality is exceptional; the hinges are robust, and the overall construction feels incredibly sturdy. I no longer constantly adjust slipping frames ‚Äì they stay perfectly in place, even during long hours at my desk or when I'm out and about. The retro round design is surprisingly versatile, complementing both my casual and more formal outfits. As one satisfied customer, vinnie nemr, noted, "I‚Äôve gotten multiple pairs of glasses from their website, and they‚Äôve all been great for the price. 50 bucks for a pair including shipping? Yes please!" I totally agree ‚Äì the value for money is outstanding. The lenses, crafted to my specific prescription, are crystal clear and provide excellent vision, reducing the eye strain I used to experience. On the downside, while the customer service before purchase might have room for improvement, as evidenced by Michael Oakes's detailed account, I haven't needed to interact with them post-delivery beyond initial tracking. This lack of post-purchase engagement, while positive for me personally, does make me wonder if issues arise, if the resolution would be as frustrating as Michael described. However, the product itself has been flawless, making the initial delivery anxiety a distant memory.
In summary, my experience with the Thom TB101 Retro Round Glasses from Cinily Eyewear has been overwhelmingly positive. They are undoubtedly "Áâ©ÊúâÊâÄÂÄº" (worth every penny), even with the minor pre-delivery communication concerns. I absolutely recommend them, especially for anyone looking for a durable, stylish, and comfortable pair of frames with a classic, vintage appeal. If you prioritize product quality and value over a seamless customer service interaction (which hopefully you won't need once you have these beauties), then these glasses are an excellent choice. They are perfect for professionals, creatives, or anyone who wants to add a touch of timeless elegance to their everyday look. The visual appeal and the comfort alone make them a standout purchase.
