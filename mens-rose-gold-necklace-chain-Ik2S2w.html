Buyer Beware! My Online Glasses Nightmare: Delays, Wrong Items & Breakages! 💔

I'm writing this review because I had an absolutely terrible online shopping experience that I hope others can learn from. My journey with this company was a complete disaster from start to finish. The shipping took what seemed like forever, especially since I desperately needed my new glasses. But when they finally arrived, the quality was incredibly poor. To make matters worse, one wasn't even the pair I had ordered! And to top it all off, in less than a month, one pair is already broken, and the arm of the second pair is falling off. I felt compelled to share my story and engage with customer service, hoping for some resolution to this unacceptable situation.
Customer: Hello, I'm calling about an order I received recently, and I'm very disappointed.
CS Rep: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you please provide your order number so I can look into this for you?
Customer: Yes, it's [Order Number]. The shipping took ages, and when they finally arrived, one pair wasn't even what I ordered. Plus, both pairs are terrible quality; one is broken, and the other's arm is falling off after less than a month.
CS Rep: I understand your frustration. That certainly sounds unacceptable, and I sincerely apologize for the incorrect item and the quality issues you've experienced. We definitely want to make this right.
Customer: So, what are you going to do about it? I needed these glasses, and now I have nothing but broken, wrong, and poor-quality frames.
CS Rep: I understand completely. Let's process a return for the incorrect and damaged glasses. I can then initiate an exchange to send you the correct pair, ensuring they meet our quality standards. Would you prefer a full refund, or for us to send out replacement glasses immediately?
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

I recently had an absolutely terrible online shopping experience for glasses that left me utterly frustrated 😤. The shipping took ages, and when they finally arrived, the quality was incredibly poor. To make matters worse, one wasn't even the pair I had ordered! And after less than a month, both pairs were broken or falling apart. I was so disappointed and felt completely ripped off 😭.
After that disaster, I was hesitant to try another online store, but I desperately needed new prescription glasses online. I decided to give cinily.net a try, hoping for a better experience 🤔. And I'm so glad I did!
My experience with cinily.net has been fantastic. I am leaving a five-star review in accordance with the ease of ordering and the virtual help I received online from Nicole when I had a question. So far so good. I have ordered before and was very pleased with my glasses, and I’m sure I will be again ✨.
The ordering process was incredibly smooth, and the customer service was genuinely helpful and responsive. Unlike my previous ordeal, the glasses from cinily.net arrived in perfect condition, and the quality is outstanding. They are exactly what I ordered, and the price was incredibly reasonable for such high-quality frames and lenses. I finally have reliable, stylish glasses that didn't break the bank! I highly recommend cinily.net for anyone looking for a reliable and satisfying purchase 😃.
