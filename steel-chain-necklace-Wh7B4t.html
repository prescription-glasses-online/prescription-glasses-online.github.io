<h3>Next-Day Delivery Nightmare: A $19.95 Fraudulent Experience! ðŸ˜ </h3>
<p></br>
My terrible online shopping experience was so frustrating, I felt compelled to share it as a cautionary tale. What was advertised as "next day delivery" turned into a week-long wait, costing me $19.95 for a service I clearly didn't receive. This place is nothing more than an automated business that cares nothing about its customers. They are a fraud, ripping customers off for services that they charge for and do NOT provide. I spent endless time trying to reach a human, only to be met with automated bots and unhelpful responses. I had to leave this review, and engage customer service again, to highlight their unprofessional practices.</p>
<p>Customer: I paid $19.95 for next-day delivery on February 18th, and my order didn't arrive until February 24th. That is clearly not next-day. I need that shipping fee refunded immediately.
CS Rep: I sincerely apologize for the significant delay with your order and for the inconvenience this has caused. I understand your frustration with the "next day delivery" not being fulfilled.
Customer: Inconvenience? I was promised next-day delivery, and you failed to deliver. My glasses had plano lenses, so there was no production delay either. Your automated system made it impossible to get a straight answer, and I emailed six times with no reply. This whole process has been absolutely horrible.
CS Rep: I completely understand your disappointment regarding the unresponsiveness and the delivery timeframe. I can confirm your express shipping fee of $19.95 will be refunded to your original payment method. Please allow 3-5 business days for this to reflect on your statement.
Customer: So, after all that, I get a refund for shipping, but the experience itself was a nightmare. This company is a fraud, with horrible customer service. I won't be returning.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

My last online shopping experience was an absolute nightmare ðŸ˜¤. I paid $19.95 for "next-day delivery" on February 18th, only for my order to arrive a week later on February 24th! The company's automated bots and unhelpful responses left me feeling completely ripped off and frustrated ðŸ˜­. I emailed them six times with no reply and spent endless time trying to reach a human. It was a total fraud, charging for services they didn't provide, and the whole experience was truly horrible.</p>
<p>After such a dreadful ordeal, I was incredibly hesitant to trust another online glasses retailer ðŸ¤”. However, I still needed new glasses and stumbled upon cinily.net. I decided to give them a try, desperately hoping for a smoother, more honest experience.</p>
<p>To my delight, the experience was completely different! As one review perfectly put it, "Great service! Rx fine! Second purchase. Both have been great!" âœ¨ From the moment I browsed their site, the process was seamless. The product quality, especially for my new 6-in-1 magnetic sunglasses, is outstanding. The customer service was responsive and genuinely helpful, a refreshing change from my previous ordeal. I was especially impressed by their range of <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=123">cheap prescription glasses online</a>, making quality eyewear truly accessible. Cinily.net has truly restored my faith in online shopping. Highly recommend! ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
