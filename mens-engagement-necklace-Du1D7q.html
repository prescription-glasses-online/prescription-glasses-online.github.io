<h3>My old glasses! ðŸ˜«</h3>
<p></br>
My old glasses, bless their heart, were really starting to show their age. The frames were bent, the lenses scratched beyond belief, and trying to read anything smaller than a billboard felt like an Olympic sport for my eyes. It wasn't just about aesthetics; it was about function. I was constantly pushing them up my nose, squinting at my computer screen, and generally feeling like my vision was a blurry mess. I needed a new pair, and not just any pair â€“ I wanted something lightweight, durable, and stylish. I'd heard whispers about online eyewear retailers offering fantastic prices, and with my budget getting tighter in 2024, the idea of skipping the traditional optical shop was becoming increasingly appealing. I was looking for a solution that wouldn't break the bank but would still deliver on quality and comfort. It's a common dilemma, I know, and I felt a strong pull towards finding that perfect balance.</p>
<p>My search led me to Cinily Eyewear. I spent hours scrolling through their impressive collection, drawn in by the promise of modern designs and competitive pricing. The specific model that caught my eye was the <a href="https://www.cinily.net/products/ultempei-tungsten-round-glasses-frame-womens-eyeglass-frame-ultralight-superelastic-prescription-women-glasses-grade-glasses?variant=39576881987620&country=US&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic">ULTEM Tungsten Round Glasses Frame</a>, advertised as ultralight and superelastic. I loved the matte black red color, and the round shape felt right for my face. The ordering process itself was straightforward enough â€“ entering my prescription, choosing lens add-ons. However, I did notice something peculiar. While browsing other reviews, I stumbled upon a detailed comment from a customer named Denise LeFrancois, who shared a very mixed experience: "Firstly, be aware that the company replies to every negative review with the same answerâ€¦.\"there was an issue with the product so it had to be remade\"! Garbage answer. I was ripped off for express shipping on several pairs and would never do that again!\nLook, I tried in vain to leave a review on the website, where my glasses are listed, but that doesn't work.\nSo after about a 10 minute search I finally am able to leave a review! The customer service is the among the worst I have ever experienced.\n\nJust so you know, don't bother paying for the faster shipping because you still will have to wait a few weeks to get your glasses. So save yourself that money as it will only get your glasses to you in about 2 days sooner. Not worth that money.\n\nMoving onâ€¦..I didn't really expect too much quality in the actual glasses but I was proven wrong! I am happy to report that they sell quality frames and the lenses are superior to what I have gotten at Lens Crafters! And that is saying a lot! I did pay for the water and fingerprint protection coating and it has proven to be a wise choice!\n\nDon't expect to hear from anyone if you reach out by email. Don't expect to really get help with the \"chat\", even though you will be transferred to \"live agent\", or so they say. I am not sold on that as truth.\nI would have given them a 5 star but the worst ever customer service brings it down to a 3 star. What a shame. They have such a great opportunity to sweep the market for online glasses but they failed and it's all due to NO CUSTOMER SERVICE!\nThey are the only ones to make a Bifocal lens..Not progressive, they also make those, but an actual LINED BIFOCAL, which is my preference. The height of the bifocal is a tad low for me, so still getting used to that. So, if you do order a bifocal, have your eye doctor give the correct height that you can pass on to Glasses USAâ€¦..they have a standard height which is NOT for everyone. The true height of the bifocal is measured on a 1:1 and goes by the individual eyes.\n\nFinally, I also read in other review that they only accept ONE glass for return. THIS IS NOT TRUE. I have sent back 3 pairs so far and may not be done until I find the perfect pair for my face. THEY DO REFUND YOUR MONEY ON ALL GLASSES SENT IN FOR RETURN! Just be reasonable and return them within 14 days. Sadly, I have another pair of everyday wear coming that may fit my face better. But then I will be stuck with the pair I am currently wearing because this current pair is now 3 days past the 14 day window. Should I try to ask for help with this from the company? Yes, I should. Will I? No way will I because they have no one to help you!! I actually just changed the 3 star to a 2 star because of the piss poor customer service. Laughable." Reading this, I decided against expedited shipping, saving myself some money, and braced myself for a bit of a wait, steeling myself against potential customer service issues.</p>
<p>After a couple of weeks, my package arrived. The box was simple, nothing overly fancy, but it protected the glasses well. Inside, the <a href="https://www.cinily.net/products/ultempei-tungsten-round-glasses-frame-womens-eyeglass-frame-ultralight-superelastic-prescription-women-glasses-grade-glasses?variant=39576881987620&country=US&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic">ULTEM Tungsten Round Glasses Frame</a> sat in a sleek, branded case. My first impression was genuinely positive. The frames felt incredibly lightweight, just as advertised, and the matte finish was elegant. They looked exactly as they did online, which is always a relief. The craftsmanship appeared solid, with no visible flaws. This initial feeling of satisfaction was a stark contrast to some of the customer service anxieties I had felt earlier.</p>
<p>Now, for the real test: actual use. Putting them on, the clarity was immediate. My vision was crisp, and the lightweight frames truly made a difference â€“ I barely felt them on my face. This echoes the surprising positive sentiment in Denise's review: "I am happy to report that they sell quality frames and the lenses are superior to what I have gotten at Lens Crafters! And that is saying a lot! I did pay for the water and fingerprint protection coating and it has proven to be a wise choice!" I also opted for the water and fingerprint protection, and it has indeed been a wise choice, keeping my lenses remarkably clean throughout the day. I primarily use these for everyday wear and computer work, and they excel. The comfortable fit means no more constant adjustments, and my eyes feel less strained after long hours in front of a screen. However, I did note Denise's point about bifocal height for those who need it: "The height of the bifocal is a tad low for me, so still getting used to that. So, if you do order a bifocal, have your eye doctor give the correct height that you can pass on to Glasses USAâ€¦..they have a standard height which is NOT for everyone." While I don't use bifocals, this is a crucial detail for others to consider, as getting the right measurements is key for optimal vision.</p>
<p>Overall, my experience with the <a href="https://www.cinily.net/products/ultempei-tungsten-round-glasses-frame-womens-eyeglass-frame-ultralight-superelastic-prescription-women-glasses-grade-glasses?variant=39576881987620&country=US&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic">Cinily Eyewear ULTEM Tungsten Round Glasses</a> has been largely positive. Despite the concerns raised by other customers regarding customer service and shipping delays, my product arrived as expected and the quality has exceeded what I anticipated for the price. The frames are truly ultralight and comfortable for extended wear, and the lenses provide excellent clarity. I would recommend these glasses, especially for those looking for a high-quality product without the hefty price tag of traditional retailers. Just be prepared for a potentially longer wait and perhaps lower your expectations for customer service responsiveness, as other users have pointed out. For me, the product itself was a clear winner, making it a "ç‰©æœ‰æ‰€å€¼" (worth the money) purchase in late 2024.
