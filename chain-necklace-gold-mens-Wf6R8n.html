ðŸš¨ WARNING: My Nightmare with Dishonest Promos & Zero Customer Service!

Let me share a terrible online shopping experience that I hope serves as a cautionary tale. This company is simply dishonest; they don't honor promos and make it impossible to collect offers when their site is full of glitches. Frankly, I found them unprofessional, with no 24-hour customer service and no agent to speak to. I felt compelled to leave this review and engage with their customer service because they messed up my order and admitted it, yet their proposed 'solution' was outrageous: I had to return my perfectly correct style and prescription items just to RETURN AND REORDER to get the BOGO they messed up. A simple credit back to my card used? Nah, that's too easy for them, apparently.
Customer: I'm calling about order #EBD12345. I was supposed to get a buy-one-get-one promotion applied, but it didn't go through, and now your website won't let me apply it.
CS Rep: I apologize for the trouble you've experienced with our website and the promotion, sir/madam. Let me look into this for you.
Customer: This is ridiculous. You admitted the mistake on your end, but your proposed solution is for me to return my perfectly fine glasses and reorder? That's unacceptable and a huge waste of my time. Why can't you just credit the difference to my card?
CS Rep: I understand your frustration, and I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this has caused. Our policy for applying missed promotions after an order is processed usually requires a return and reorder for the system to correctly apply the discount. I know this isn't ideal, but it's how our system is set up to ensure the promotion is properly linked.
Customer: Well, your system is flawed then! I just want the promo applied to what I already bought. This process is unprofessional.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

âœ¨ From Online Shopping Hell to Eyewear Heaven: Cinily.net Redeemed My Experience!

After experiencing such incredible comfort and clarity, I can confidently say that these lenses have transformed my daily screen time. If you're tired of eye strain and seeking a superior visual experience, I highly recommend you check out the Anti Blue Light Blocking Lenses that made all the difference for me. They truly are a game-changer for anyone spending hours in front of digital devices.

I recently had a truly awful online shopping experience that left me feeling completely scammed and frustrated ðŸ˜¤. Another company was dishonest, refusing to honor promotions, and their site was a glitchy mess that made it impossible to apply offers. To make matters worse, their customer service was non-existent â€“ no 24-hour support, no agent to speak to. When they messed up my order, they admitted it, but their "solution" was outrageous: I had to return my perfectly correct style and prescription items just to reorder and get the BOGO offer they'd messed up. Why couldn't they just credit my card? It was unprofessional and a huge waste of my time ðŸ˜­.
After that debacle, I was incredibly hesitant to try buying eyewear online again ðŸ¤”. But I still needed new glasses, and I was determined to find a reliable alternative. That's when I decided to give cinily.net a try, hoping for a completely different experience.
And what a difference! Just like one happy customer shared, "Superb service. The glasses are exactly what I wanted and fit perfectly." My experience was exactly the same. The website was incredibly user-friendly and smooth, a refreshing change. The quality of their prescription glasses for men is outstanding âœ¨, especially considering the price. It's fantastic value for money. Their customer service was prompt and genuinely helpful, addressing my minor queries with ease, unlike my previous nightmare. I truly feel like I found a hidden gem that actually cares about its customers. Highly recommend! ðŸ˜ƒ
