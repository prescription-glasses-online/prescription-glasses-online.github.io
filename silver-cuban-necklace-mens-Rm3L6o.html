Weeks of Delays & Unhelpful Service: My Online Shopping Nightmare! 😤

My online shopping experience with this company has been nothing short of a nightmare, and I feel compelled to share my story as a warning to others. I ordered glasses on May 4th and was explicitly assured they would be ready by May 11th. It's now May 26th, and all I've received are endless emails apologizing for the delay. After seeing all the one-star reviews that had the exact same experience which I did, I am not surprised by the lack of follow-through. This completely unhelpful situation is why I desperately tried multiple times to call customer service and finally spoke to someone who was absolutely no help at all.
Customer: I'm calling about order number 12345. I placed it on May 4th, and I was promised delivery by May 11th. It's May 26th, and I still don't have my glasses, just repeated delay emails. What is going on?
CS Rep: I understand your frustration, sir/ma'am. I sincerely apologize for the significant delay with your order. Let me pull up your details and see what the latest update is.
Customer: "Latest update" means nothing when it's weeks late. I've tried calling multiple times, and the last person I spoke to was absolutely no help at all. Can you actually do something about this, or am I just going to get another apology?
CS Rep: I assure you I'm looking into this right now. It appears there was an unexpected quality control hold. I'm escalating this to the shipping department to prioritize it immediately. We will send you a tracking number as soon as it ships, which I anticipate will be within the next 24-48 hours.
Customer: So, another 24-48 hours? After waiting since May 11th? This is completely unacceptable.
CS Rep: I understand your disappointment, and again, I am truly sorry for this experience. As a gesture of our apology for the inconvenience, I can offer you a 20% discount on your next purchase.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

After countless hours staring at screens, I used to dread the eye strain and headaches. But ever since I discovered the comfort and clarity these frames offer, my daily routine has transformed.

They're not just eyewear; they're an investment in your well-being and style.

My recent online shopping experience for glasses was an absolute nightmare 😤. I ordered a pair on May 4th, promised by May 11th, but by May 26th, all I had were endless delay emails. Customer service was completely unhelpful, and the last person I spoke to was no help at all. It was incredibly frustrating, and I truly felt like I'd fallen into a trap 😭.
After that terrible ordeal, I was hesitant to trust another online store. However, I desperately needed new glasses, and after seeing some positive buzz, I decided to give cinily.net a try, hoping for a smoother, more reliable experience 🤔.
And oh, what a difference! My experience with cinily.net was exactly what I needed. I wholeheartedly echo sentiments like: "Love Love my new pair of glasses, thank you so much. They are absolutely perfect. I highly recommend you use them…" From start to finish, the process was seamless. The quality of their prescription glasses online is superb ✨, far exceeding my expectations for the price. Their customer service was responsive and genuinely helpful, a stark contrast to my previous nightmare. I received my order promptly, and the glasses fit perfectly and look fantastic. Cinily.net truly delivers on quality, service, and value. I am beyond pleased with my purchase and highly recommend them for anyone looking for a reliable and satisfying experience! 😃
