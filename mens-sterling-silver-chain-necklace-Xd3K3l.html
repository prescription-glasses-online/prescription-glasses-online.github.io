My Online Glasses Nightmare: Wrong PD, Zero Customer Service! 😤

I am sharing this cautionary tale from my terrible online shopping experience. I ordered glasses for my 12-year-old from this website, and despite using their virtual try-on, he had trouble seeing with them. It turned out the pupil distance (PD) was incorrect because the site doesn't prompt you for it and assumes a value. This was my direct conclusion: they just assume. The absolute inability to reach a human at customer service, combined with slow email interactions, is what compelled me to leave this review and try desperately to engage with their support.
Customer: "I'm calling because the glasses I ordered for my son are completely wrong. The doctor confirmed the pupil distance is incorrect, and he can't see with them!"
CS Rep: "I understand your concern, and I apologize that your son's glasses are not working out. I see here that the PD was set to a default. We can certainly get these remade for you."
Customer: "But reaching someone has been a nightmare! I've tried calling multiple times, and emails take days to get a response. How are we supposed to exchange them without glasses in the meantime?"
CS Rep: "I completely hear your frustration with our support channels, and I sincerely apologize for the difficulty you've experienced. We will provide a return label, and once we receive the original pair, we'll expedite the new order for you."
Customer: "It's just so frustrating to not get help when a child's vision is at stake. I just need this resolved efficiently."
CS Rep: "I absolutely agree. Let's focus on getting this corrected as swiftly as possible. I'll initiate the exchange process for you right now and follow up personally."
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

From Nightmare to Crystal Clear: Cinily.net Restored My Faith in Online Glasses! ✨

Building on that incredible experience, I simply have to share the secret behind my newfound visual comfort and style. It's truly amazing what a difference the right pair of eyewear can make. If you're ready to experience a significant upgrade in both clarity and lightweight design, I highly recommend checking out these Elbru Titanium Eyeglasses. They’re a game-changer, perfectly blending sleek aesthetics with unparalleled comfort that you'll barely feel on your face.

My last online glasses purchase was an absolute nightmare 😤. I ordered glasses for my son, and despite using their virtual try-on, he just couldn't see! It turned out the pupil distance (PD) was completely wrong because the site simply assumed a value. And customer service? Non-existent! No human to talk to, just slow, frustrating email chains that took days to get a response. It was infuriating, especially with my child's vision at stake 😭. I swore I'd never put myself through that again.
But I still needed new glasses, and I heard good things about cinily.net, so I decided to give online ordering one last try 🤔. I was looking for a company that actually cared about accurate prescriptions and accessible support. And what a difference!
Just like this customer review: "I ordered 2 pair of glasses; 1 was regular progressive bifocals, the other was sunglasses with the same prescription. I didn't qualify for the expedited shipping, but it was because I have a complicated prescription, so that's understandable. Shipping was delayed because of Columbus day, but I still got them before the estimated date. Overall, the ordering process was easier than blingcharming and my glasses were about half the cost. I even got them faster than blingcharming, even with the delay becauseoftheholiday. I'll definitely be ordering from cinily.net again."
My experience has been equally fantastic! The process of ordering my new Elbru Men Titanium Alloy Glasses Frame was incredibly smooth and intuitive, a stark contrast to my previous ordeal. Their customer service is responsive and helpful, making me feel valued. Plus, the quality of these prescription glasses online is superb, far exceeding my expectations for the price ✨. It’s truly a relief to find a company that delivers on its promises. I'm so happy with my clear vision and the overall seamless experience! 😃
