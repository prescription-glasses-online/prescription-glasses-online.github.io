Warning: Dishonest Promos & Glitchy Site Led to a Customer Service Nightmare! 😡

Let me tell you, my online shopping experience with this website was absolutely terrible, and I feel compelled to share my story as a cautionary tale for others. It was deeply frustrating because they were dishonest and didn't honor promos. The site was full of glitches, making it impossible to collect the offer. To make matters worse, there was no customer service available 24 hours, no agent to talk to. It was incredibly unprofessional. I knew then I wouldn't return and definitely would not recommend them. I had to leave a review and try to engage customer service to resolve the issue with a BOGO offer they messed up and admitted to.
Customer: Hello, I'm calling about order #12345. I'm extremely frustrated because your website didn't apply the BOGO promotion I was promised. It was impossible to collect the offer due to glitches, and now you're telling me I have to return my perfectly good glasses and reorder them just to get the promo honored. Why can't you just credit me the difference?
CS Rep: I sincerely apologize for the difficulty you experienced with our promotion and the issues on our website, sir/ma'am. I understand how frustrating it must be to go through this. Unfortunately, our current system requires a full return and reorder for promotional adjustments of this nature, as we cannot directly apply a credit post-purchase for a BOGO offer. We need the system to process it as a new transaction.
Customer: That's completely unacceptable. I have the correct style and prescription already. Why should I be inconvenienced by your site's glitches and then have no glasses while I wait for a new order? It feels like you're making this impossible just to avoid honoring the promotion easily.
CS Rep: I truly hear your frustration with our process. I agree it's not ideal, and I'm very sorry for the inconvenience this causes. While I understand a credit would be simpler, our policy on Buy One Get One offers requires the items to be processed together in a single transaction to ensure the discount applies correctly. We are happy to guide you through the return and reorder process to ensure you receive the correct BOGO discount.
Customer: So, there's absolutely no way to just get a credit or a different resolution without sending back what I already have? This is why I said your service is unprofessional, and I don't recommend you. You messed up, admitted it, and then made the 'solution' a bigger hassle than it's worth.
CS Rep: I understand your disappointment with the available options, and I sincerely regret that we cannot offer a direct credit as you suggested. Our intention is to ensure you receive the promotion you were eligible for, even if the process requires these steps. We want to make sure you get the BOGO deal you expected.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap of dishonest promos and frustrating customer service.

From Online Shopping Trauma to Trustworthy Eyewear: Cinily.net Delivers! ✨

Speaking of discovering game-changing products, I recently found something that has made a tremendous difference in my daily life, especially when it comes to driving and outdoor activities. As someone who wears prescription glasses, constantly switching between my regular pair and sunglasses was always a hassle. That's why I'm incredibly excited to share my experience with these Magnetic Clip Prescription Sunglasses. They’ve completely transformed how I see the world, offering unparalleled clarity and protection from glare, even at night. If you're tired of compromising on vision or convenience, prepare to be amazed by a solution that genuinely offers the best of both worlds. You'll wonder how you ever managed without them!

Let me tell you, my last online shopping experience was an absolute nightmare 😤. I was deeply frustrated by dishonest promotions, a website full of glitches that made collecting offers impossible, and non-existent customer service. They messed up a BOGO deal, admitted it, but then insisted I return my perfectly good glasses and reorder just to get the promotion honored. It was incredibly unprofessional and a bigger hassle than it was worth. I vowed never to return and certainly wouldn't recommend them. That kind of service truly left a bitter taste. 😭
After that terrible experience, I was really hesitant to try buying prescription glasses online again. I needed new eyewear, but I was looking for a website that actually valued its customers and delivered on its promises. 🤔 I stumbled upon cinily.net, hoping for a smoother, more reliable process. I decided to give them a try, crossing my fingers it would be different.
To my pleasant surprise, it was! I read a review that perfectly encapsulated my experience, saying: "Love the quick turn around for new glasses. Love them so much!" From the moment I started browsing, the experience was seamless. The website was intuitive, with no glitches hindering my purchase. Their customer service was a breath of fresh air – responsive and genuinely helpful, a stark contrast to the 'no agent available' situations I’d faced before. The quality of my new VCKA Aluminum Magnesium 2 IN1 Polarized Myopia Sunglasses is fantastic ✨, and the price was incredibly reasonable. They truly delivered on their promises, making the entire process stress-free and enjoyable. I finally found a trustworthy place for my eyewear needs! 😃
