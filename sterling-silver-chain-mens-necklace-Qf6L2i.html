Online Shopping Nightmare: Wrong Prescription & Zero Customer Service! 😤

I have to share my terrible online shopping experience as a cautionary tale for everyone. They sent me the wrong prescription safety glasses, causing dizziness and nausea, and that was just the beginning. It's been impossible to get a hold of a live person to actually help get this resolved. After multiple chat sessions, phone calls, and emails, I still can't get in touch with anyone. I felt compelled to leave this review and try to engage with customer service because wearing these glasses is dangerous, and their lack of support is utterly frustrating.
Customer: I'm calling because I received the wrong prescription safety glasses, and wearing them is causing me dizziness and nausea. This is completely unacceptable and frankly, unsafe. I’ve tried multiple times to get help!
CS Rep: I am so sorry to hear about the discomfort and safety issue you're experiencing, and I completely understand how frustrating it must be to not get a timely resolution. Can you please provide your order number so I can pull up your details?
Customer: My order number is [Order Number]. I've already spent days trying to reach a live person through chat and email. It's been impossible, and I just keep getting generic responses. I need this fixed now.
CS Rep: Thank you for that, I see your order. Please accept our deepest apologies for the incorrect prescription and the significant difficulty you've faced trying to contact us. This is absolutely not the service standard we aim for. I am immediately processing a free return label for the incorrect glasses and setting up a priority reorder for the correct prescription, which will be double-checked before dispatch. We will also expedite shipping on the new pair at no additional cost to you.
Customer: So I have to go through the whole return process again, and then wait even longer for a new pair? This is beyond frustrating when my safety depends on these!
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap of bad products and non-existent customer service.

My last online shopping experience was an absolute nightmare! 😤 They sent me the completely wrong prescription safety glasses, which caused terrible dizziness and nausea. Trying to get it resolved was impossible; I spent days on chat, phone calls, and emails, only to be met with silence or generic bot responses. It was incredibly frustrating and frankly, dangerous. 😭
After that terrible ordeal, I was hesitant to order glasses online again, but I desperately needed a new pair. I decided to give cinily.net a try, hoping for a better experience, especially since I needed reliable prescription glasses this time. 🤔
To my pleasant surprise, my experience with cinily.net has been fantastic! I even saw another happy customer rave, 'I love love love my new glasses!!' and I completely agree! ✨ From the moment I started browsing their site, the process was incredibly smooth. Their selection of frames was impressive, and the prices were unbeatable for such high quality. My new glasses arrived quickly, and they are absolutely perfect – clear, comfortable, and stylish. The customer service I encountered was also a breath of fresh air; responsive, helpful, and genuinely caring. No more generic responses or endless waits! I finally feel safe and stylish with my vision corrected. Highly, highly recommend! 😃
