Prescription Nightmare: Dizziness, Nausea & Zero Customer Service! 😵‍💫😡

My online shopping experience was absolutely terrible, and I feel compelled to share my cautionary tale. They sent me the wrong prescription safety glasses, causing dizziness and nausea. It’s been impossible to get ahold of a live person to actually help get this resolved, despite multiple chat sessions, phone calls, and emails. I was utterly frustrated and needed to address this serious error, which is why I'm leaving this review and pushing for a real conversation with customer service.
Customer: I received safety glasses with the wrong prescription! They're causing me dizziness and nausea, and I can't believe how hard it is to speak to a real person.
CS Rep: I am so sorry to hear about this distressing experience. That is absolutely not what we want for our customers. Can I please get your order number to look into this for you?
Customer: It's [Order Number]. This has been a nightmare. I've tried chats, calls, emails, and nobody helps.
CS Rep: Thank you for the order number. I see the details here. We sincerely apologize for the incorrect prescription and the difficulty you've faced reaching us. We will certainly arrange for a return and send you a corrected pair immediately.
Customer: So I won't have to go through another endless cycle of unhelpful bots and unanswered messages? I need this fixed promptly.
CS Rep: Not at all. I will personally ensure this is expedited and provide you with a direct contact for follow-up. We'll send you a return label and place the new order today.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

I recently had a truly dreadful online shopping experience for glasses. They sent me the wrong prescription, leaving me dizzy and nauseous 😤. And trying to get a hold of a human to fix it? Impossible! Multiple chats, calls, emails, all leading to frustrating dead ends 😭. It felt like I was trapped in an endless loop of unhelpful bots and unanswered messages, and I was utterly fed up.
After that nightmare, I was incredibly hesitant to trust another online glasses retailer 🤔. But my old pair was truly on its last legs, and I desperately needed a reliable solution. That's when I decided to give cinily.net a shot, hoping for a completely different experience. I saw a positive review that simply said, "OMG, I love my new glasses. So fun and super comfortable," and that little snippet gave me the courage to try again.
When my order from cinily.net arrived, it was a complete turnaround! The quality of the frames and lenses is exceptional ✨. Their selection of cat eye prescription glasses is stunning, and I found exactly what I was looking for. The prices are fantastic too, offering great value without compromising on quality. And the customer service? A breath of fresh air! I had a minor question, and they responded quickly and genuinely helped me. The whole process, from browsing to checkout, was incredibly smooth and user-friendly. I'm so relieved and happy with my new glasses and the entire experience! 😃
