Warning! Dishonest Promos & Zero Service: My Online Shopping Nightmare 😡

I'm writing this to warn others about my terrible online shopping experience. This company proved to be Dishonest, doesn't honor promos. The website was full of glitches, making it impossible to collect the offer I was due. When I tried to get help, there was No customer Service 24 hours, no agent. It was utterly Unprofessional. I felt compelled to leave a review and engage with customer service because they completely messed up my order, and their proposed solution was so unreasonable that I declared, "I Will NOT return and I do NOT recommend them."
Customer: I'm really frustrated. I placed an order with a buy-one-get-one-free promotion, but the discount never applied, and your site was glitching.
CS Rep: I apologize for the trouble you experienced, especially with the website and the promotion. Can you please provide your order number so I can look into this for you?
Customer: Yes, it's [Order Number]. The issue is, your team admitted the error but told me I have to return my glasses, which are the correct style and prescription, just to reorder to get the BOGO. That's ridiculous!
CS Rep: I understand how inconvenient and frustrating that solution sounds, especially since the glasses are correct. Our system typically requires a re-order to apply retroactive promotions, but I agree it's not ideal.
Customer: "Not ideal" is an understatement. A simple credit back to my card would be the obvious solution. Why is that too difficult? I'm not sending back perfect glasses to jump through hoops.
CS Rep: You're right, a direct credit would be simpler. Let me check if there's an exceptional workaround I can offer, perhaps a partial refund to match the BOGO value, instead of asking you to return and reorder. Please allow me a moment.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

I recently had a truly dreadful online shopping experience that left me utterly frustrated 😤. The website was a mess of glitches, making it impossible to claim a promised BOGO offer. When I finally reached customer service, they were unhelpful, proposing the ridiculous solution of returning perfectly good glasses just to reorder them and get the discount. I swore I would never return to that unprofessional company and certainly wouldn't recommend them 😭.
After that disaster, I was hesitant to shop for glasses online again. But I really needed a new pair, and I decided to give cinily.net a try, hoping for a smoother, more transparent process 🤔. I was looking for a company that valued its customers and delivered on its promises.
And what a difference it was! My experience with cinily.net was fantastic. As one happy customer put it, "Loved the overall experience! From picking my own frames from the selection, 'trying' them out virtually and reasonable cost!" ✨ I completely agree! The website was incredibly user-friendly, and finding the perfect frames was a breeze. I was able to easily find and compare different styles.
The quality of the glasses I received from cinily.net is exceptional, especially considering the price point. It felt so good to finally have a positive online shopping experience. Their commitment to customer satisfaction truly shines through. If you're looking to buy prescription glasses online, I wholeheartedly recommend cinily.net. You won't be disappointed! 😃
