Online Shopping Nightmare: Scratched Glasses & Customer Service Hell! 😤

Let me tell you, my recent online shopping experience was nothing short of a nightmare, and I'm sharing it as a cautionary tale for anyone considering this company. I spent $372 on glasses that arrived SCRATCHED, and trying to get this resolved has been an absolute disaster. It's been 2 days of trying to TALK TO A HUMAN to fix this issue, with absolutely no luck. The "bot" just keeps sending the return label to an email I never received, and even after FINALLY TALKING TO A HUMAN, they sent the WRONG INFORMATION FOR THE RETURN. This level of ineptitude is mind-boggling, and it's why I felt compelled to leave this review and finally demand a proper conversation with customer service.
Customer: I am absolutely furious. I spent $372 on glasses that arrived scratched, and I've been trying for two days to get a return label sent to the correct email! Your bot is useless, and when I finally spoke to someone, they sent me the wrong return information. This is unacceptable!
CS Rep: I sincerely apologize for the frustrating experience you've had, especially with scratched glasses and the difficulties in initiating a return. I understand how incredibly upsetting this must be, and I want to assure you that I'm here to help resolve this for you right now. Can you please confirm your order number and the email address you'd like the return label sent to?
Customer: My order number is [Order Number], and the email is [Customer's Email]. I need the correct return label immediately, and I expect a clear plan for how this will be handled without further errors. I've already wasted so much time.
CS Rep: Thank you for providing that. I'm processing a new return label to the email address you just confirmed. It should arrive within the next 15 minutes. Additionally, I'll personally follow up within the hour to ensure you've received it and to guide you through the next steps for the return and your refund. We want to make sure this is rectified promptly.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

My last online shopping experience was an absolute nightmare 😤. I spent $372 on glasses that arrived totally SCRATCHED, and trying to get a refund or replacement was a disaster. It was two days of futile attempts to talk to a human, dealing with a useless bot, and even when I finally did reach someone, they sent the WRONG return information. The frustration was immense, and I truly believed I was done with buying glasses online 😭.
However, I desperately needed new glasses, and after that awful experience, I was determined to find a reliable online store 🤔. I started looking for companies with better reviews and a clear commitment to customer satisfaction. That's when I decided to give cinily.net a try. I thought, "Surely, it can't be worse than my last experience, and perhaps I can find the quality and service I deserve."
And I'm so glad I did! From the moment I landed on their website, the experience was remarkably smooth. It’s exactly what I needed after my previous debacle. As one reviewer aptly put it, "The affordability allows me to have tons of prescription eyewear!" This really resonated with me, and cinily.net delivered. Their product quality is excellent, and the prices are incredibly competitive, making it genuinely easy to get affordable prescription glasses online. The customer service was responsive and helpful, not a frustrating bot in sight! My new glasses arrived quickly, perfectly made, and completely scratch-free 😃✨. What a relief! I'm genuinely impressed and will definitely be a returning customer.
