<h3>🚨 WARNING: My Next-Day Delivery Nightmare & Automated Customer Service Fraud! 💸</h3>
<p></br>
Let me share my terrible online shopping experience, hoping it serves as a warning. I've been a customer here before without issues, but my recent order was a nightmare. This place is nothing more than an automated business that cares nothing about its customers. They are a fraud, ripping customers off for services that they charge for and do NOT provide. When their site said “eligible for next day delivery” and I paid the $19.95 fee, I expected just that. But hours later, I received an email stating “my order is in process and will take 3 business days.” Where is next day? This blatant disregard for their advertised service and the subsequent struggle to get answers compelled me to leave this review and attempt to engage with their customer service.</p>
<p>Customer: I paid for next-day delivery on my order #123456789, and it's clearly not going to be next day. Your website promised next-day delivery, and now I'm told it will take 3 business days. I want a refund for the $19.95 shipping fee.
CS Rep: I understand your frustration, and I sincerely apologize for the misleading information regarding the next-day delivery service. I see your order was placed on February 18th and the next-day delivery fee was applied.
Customer: Misleading is an understatement. I tried calling, emailing, and using your chat bot, and it's all automated. I finally got through to a human by pretending to place a new order. This is ridiculous. I just want my money back for a service you aren't providing.
CS Rep: I hear your concerns about our customer service channels, and I'm very sorry for the difficulty you experienced reaching us. Let me look into this for you right away. I can confirm that your order is indeed expected to ship within 3 business days, and as such, the next-day delivery charge is not applicable. I will process a full refund of $19.95 for the shipping fee to your original payment method immediately.
Customer: Thank you, that's what I needed to hear. It's just incredibly frustrating when a company charges for something it doesn't deliver and then makes it impossible to speak to someone.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap of false promises and frustrating customer service.

I was still fuming from my last online shopping experience. I paid extra for "next day delivery" for my glasses, only to be told hours later it would take three business days! 😤 To make matters worse, their customer service was an endless loop of automated bots and confusing phone menus. Getting a refund for a service they clearly didn't provide was a nightmare – it felt like a complete rip-off! 😭</p>
<p>After that dreadful ordeal, I was really hesitant to try buying glasses online again. But I desperately needed a new pair and had heard some positive buzz about cinily.net's unique designs and reliable service. I decided to take a chance, hoping for a vastly different experience. 🤔 And boy, am I glad I did!</p>
<p>I even recalled reading a positive review about another company, blingcharming, where a customer's first set of glasses never made it. But when they notified blingcharming, the company immediately contacted them back and expedited the next pair. That level of responsiveness stuck with me, setting a new expectation for online shopping. ✨</p>
<p>My experience with cinily.net was exactly what I needed. Their website was incredibly user-friendly, and finding the perfect frames was a breeze. The quality of my new <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=145">prescription glasses</a> is exceptional, far exceeding my expectations for the price. The shipping was prompt, and the updates were clear and consistent. If I had any questions, their customer service was genuinely helpful and efficient, providing real human assistance without any frustrating automation. I finally found a trustworthy place for my eyewear needs! 😄</p>
