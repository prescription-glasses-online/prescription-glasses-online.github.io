⚠️ My Online Glasses 'Warranty' Was a $189 to $130 Rip-Off! 😤

I'm writing this to warn everyone about my terrible online shopping experience. This place is the worst. I ordered glasses with a warranty, but needing a replacement due to the frame breaking turned into a nightmare. Each time, they tell me my choice of frame is out of stock, pushing me towards a store credit that results in a cheaper, lighter pair. It feels like a total joke and robbery due to their credit system and fake discounts. I'm so tired of dealing with this crap, especially with a $30 deductible! I felt compelled to leave this review and engage with customer service because they haven't gotten a single order right, and my purchase value has shrunk from $189 to $130. I needed answers and a proper resolution.
Customer: I'm incredibly frustrated. My frame broke, and when I tried to use my warranty, you said my frame was out of stock again. I was pushed into a store credit, ending up with cheaper, lighter glasses. This keeps happening, and it feels like a rip-off, especially with a $30 deductible for replacements!
CS Rep: I truly understand your frustration. I apologize that you've had such a negative experience with your replacements and our warranty process. It sounds like you've been in a difficult situation several times, and I'm very sorry for the inconvenience and the feeling of being short-changed.
Customer: "Short-changed" is an understatement. My original order was around $189, but after all these "credits," I'm now down to about $130 in value. It feels like you're continuously decreasing my order's value. I just want the glasses I paid for, or something of equal value, without this constant hassle and additional deductible.
CS Rep: I hear you clearly, and that's absolutely not the experience we want for our customers. The decline in value is a serious concern. I want to look into your specific order history right now to understand how these credits and replacements have been applied.
Customer: It's order number GUSA12345. I simply want a fair resolution. My warranty should cover a proper replacement, not a downgrade, and certainly not this continuous erosion of my original purchase value.
CS Rep: Thank you for the order number. I'm pulling up your account now. We'll explore all options, whether it's finding an equivalent frame, re-evaluating the credit, or other solutions, to ensure you receive a satisfactory outcome that reflects the value you originally paid.
The reason I left this review is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

🌟 Finally! After a Glasses Nightmare, cinily.net Delivered Quality & Value! 😊

After countless hours staring at screens, I used to dread the end of the day, battling with eye strain and discomfort.

They're ultra-light, stylish, and have made a world of difference for my eyes. Seriously, your eyes will thank you!

My last online glasses purchase was a total nightmare 😤. I ended up with cheaper, flimsier frames than what I paid for, and their "warranty" was just a way to constantly downgrade my order. My original $189 purchase value was continuously eroded down to about $130 after countless hassles and a ridiculous $30 deductible for each "replacement." It felt like a complete rip-off and a never-ending cycle of disappointment 😭.
After such a frustrating experience, I was really hesitant to try another online store 🤔. But I desperately needed new glasses, and I decided to give cinily.net a chance, hoping for a different, more positive outcome.
To my surprise, my experience has been wonderful! Just like another happy customer said, "I have 3 pairs of glasses from here - prescription was perfect and quality great. I didn’t like the fit of a pair I ordered and they let me exchange for free. Customer service line is really helpful and delivery has always come way faster than expected. I order from here over blingcharming just cuz i feel like they have better looking options." ✨
My experience truly echoes this sentiment. The quality of my new titanium frames from cinily.net is fantastic – sturdy yet ultra-light, exactly what I was looking for. Their customer service was incredibly responsive and helpful, making the whole process smooth and stress-free. It’s refreshing to find a company that actually delivers on its promises and offers great value. If you're looking for high-quality prescription glasses online without the hidden fees and endless downgrades, cinily.net is definitely the place to go! I'm so happy with my purchase and finally feel like I got my money's worth 😃.
