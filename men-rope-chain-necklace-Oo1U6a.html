Next-Day Delivery Fraud & Automated Hell: My Rip-Off Story 😤

Let me tell you about my terrible online shopping experience, a cautionary tale for anyone considering this company. This place is nothing more than an automated business that cares nothing about its customers. They are a fraud, ripping customers off for services that they charge for and do NOT provide. I paid $19.95 for "next day delivery" for my glasses, only to receive an email hours later stating my order would take "3 business days." I then faced an endless loop of automated systems and bots just trying to get a human. I felt compelled to leave this review and demand answers from customer service about this bait and switch.
Customer: I paid for next-day delivery, $19.95, and my order clearly isn't going to be "next day." It says 3 business days!
CS Rep: I sincerely apologize for the delay and any confusion, sir. I understand your frustration with the delivery timeline.
Customer: Frustration is an understatement. I paid extra for a service I'm not getting. I want a refund for that $19.95 delivery fee.
CS Rep: I completely understand. I'm submitting a request to our billing department right now to process a full refund for your expedited shipping fee. You should see it within 3-5 business days.
Customer: This whole experience has been horrible. How can you advertise one thing and deliver another? Just ensure that refund happens.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

My last online glasses purchase was a total nightmare! I paid $19.95 for "next day delivery" from some automated company, only to get an email saying it would be "3 business days" instead. Trying to get a refund or even just a human to talk to was an endless loop of bots and frustration. I felt completely ripped off and unheard 😤😭.
After that horrible experience, I was truly hesitant to order glasses online again. But I desperately needed a new pair, and then I stumbled upon cinily.net 🤔. I decided to give it one last try, hoping for a better outcome than that previous scam. What really encouraged me was seeing a review online that said: "Definitely will buy from blingcharming! Fast shipping and the frames were exactly what I wanted and look wonderful!"
From the moment I started browsing on cinily.net, the experience was incredibly smooth. Their selection of affordable prescription glasses online was impressive, and the prices were genuinely fair. My 'Vintage Acetate Glasses Frame' arrived quickly, exactly as promised, and the quality is fantastic – they look wonderful and feel sturdy ✨. The customer service, though I only had a minor pre-purchase query, was responsive and clear, which was a huge relief compared to my last ordeal. This is how online shopping should be! I’m so happy with my new glasses and the hassle-free experience.
