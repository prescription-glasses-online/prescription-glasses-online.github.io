Next-Day Delivery Nightmare: A $19.95 Scam! 💸😡

Let me tell you about my terrible online shopping experience, hoping it serves as a cautionary tale. I've ordered twice from this place before, without any issues, so I never understood the negative reviews. But this third time, it was a nightmare. This place is nothing more than an automated business that cares nothing about its customers; they are a fraud, ripping customers off for services they charge for and do NOT provide. Their site said "eligible for next day delivery", so I paid the $19.95 fee. Hours later, I get an email saying it'll take 3 business days! Where's "next day"? I felt compelled to leave this review and engage with customer service because this level of dishonesty and lack of support is unacceptable.
Customer: My order was supposed to be next day delivery, and I paid $19.95 for it. Why did I get an email saying it will take 3 business days? This is unacceptable.
CS Rep: I understand your frustration. Let me check the details for your order. Sometimes, next-day eligibility has specific cut-off times or exceptions.
Customer: I placed the order correctly. I paid for a service I'm not receiving. I want my $19.95 delivery fee refunded immediately.
CS Rep: I apologize for this inconvenience. I can certainly submit a refund request for the express delivery fee to our billing department for review.
Customer: "Submit a request"? I paid for a service that was advertised and not provided. Why can't you just process the refund now? This is exactly why your customer service is so frustrating.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

I recently had an absolutely terrible online shopping experience, and it was a nightmare! I paid $19.95 for "next day delivery" from another site, only to get an email hours later saying it would take 3 business days! 😤 Their customer service was a complete joke – all automated bots, no human interaction, and they simply refused to process a refund for a service they clearly didn't provide. It felt like a total fraud, just ripping customers off. So much dishonesty and frustration! 😭
After that ordeal, I was incredibly hesitant to trust another online glasses store. I desperately needed new frames, but the thought of another scam made me wary. 🤔 However, I stumbled upon cinily.net and decided to give them a try, hoping for a different experience.
My experience with cinily.net was a breath of fresh air! The website was intuitive, making it incredibly easy to order prescription glasses online. Finding the perfect frames and inputting my prescription was a breeze. When I made a silly error entering my details, their customer service was outstanding. They were polite, quick, and efficient. They even started making my corrected glasses before I'd shipped the original pair back! New ones arrived quickly, and I'm absolutely loving them. ✨
The quality of the glasses is fantastic, especially for the price. This isn't my first time ordering from cinily.net, and it definitely won't be my last. They've completely restored my faith in online shopping for eyewear. Highly recommended! 😃
