🚨 Warning! This Company Is a Fraud: My Next-Day Delivery Fee Was a Scam! 😠

It all started with a simple order, hoping for new glasses quickly. What I got instead was a terrible online shopping experience, one I want to warn everyone about. I paid for a service that was never provided, got stuck in an endless loop of automation, and felt utterly disregarded as a customer. This place is nothing more than an automated business that cares nothing about its customers. They are a fraud, ripping customers off for services that they charge for and do NOT provide. I paid for the $19.95 next day delivery fee, only to receive an email stating my order would take 3 business days, which turned into almost a week. I felt compelled to leave a review and engage with customer service because this was simply unacceptable.
Customer: I paid for next-day delivery, and my order clearly isn't next-day. It’s been days. Where is my refund for the $19.95 delivery fee?
CS Rep: I understand your frustration with the delivery timeline. Let me check the details of your order for you.
Customer: You said "eligible for next-day delivery" on your site, and it wasn't. This feels like a bait and switch. I've sent multiple emails and haven't heard back from anyone.
CS Rep: I sincerely apologize for the delay in your delivery and for the lack of response to your emails. That's certainly not the experience we want you to have. I'm escalating this to our billing department right now to investigate the delivery fee.
Customer: I expect that refund processed immediately. And frankly, your automated system and lack of human support are horrible. I had to pretend to place a new order just to speak to someone!
CS Rep: I hear your concerns about our customer service channels, and I'm very sorry for the difficulty you experienced. I've noted your feedback, and we are constantly working to improve. I will ensure the billing department looks into this refund as a priority.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

Speaking of discovering pieces that truly resonate with your personal style, I can't recommend my latest find enough. These aren't just any glasses; they've become an essential part of my daily ensemble, effortlessly blending classic aesthetics with a modern edge. If you're eager to experience that same blend of unique design and undeniable comfort, then you simply must explore these Wood Grain Retro Round Glasses. They're truly a game-changer for anyone looking to make a subtle yet striking statement.

My last online glasses order was an absolute nightmare from start to finish! 😤 I paid for next-day delivery, only for my package to take almost a week, and then I was completely ignored by their automated customer service. It felt like a total scam, ripping customers off for services they simply didn't provide. I was so frustrated and disappointed, swearing off online eyewear for good. 😭
But time passed, and I still needed new glasses. I kept seeing positive reviews for other online providers, which made me reconsider. 🤔 I read one review that genuinely made me hopeful: "This is my third pair of glasses I have received. I am very happy with all of them. I have gotten so many compliments on my last pair. I’m always recommending blingcharming. Thank you for all you do." That gave me the courage to try again, this time with cinily.net.
And what a difference it was! From the moment I started browsing, the process was incredibly smooth. The website was easy to navigate, and finding the perfect pair was a breeze. My affordable prescription glasses arrived much faster than I anticipated, and the quality is simply outstanding! ✨ The frames are stylish and feel incredibly durable. Their customer service was actually helpful and responsive, a stark contrast to my previous ordeal. I've finally found a trustworthy place for my eyewear needs. Highly recommended! 😃
