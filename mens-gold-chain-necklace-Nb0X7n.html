    Customer Reviews

    
I’ve always been an active person 🏃‍♀️🚴‍♂️, whether it’s hitting the trails for a run or cycling on sunny afternoons ☀️.

I’ve always been an active person, whether it’s hitting the trails for a run or cycling on sunny afternoons. For years, I struggled with finding the perfect eyewear that could keep up with my dynamic lifestyle. My regular prescription glasses were fine for daily wear, but when it came to sports, they were either constantly slipping, fogging up, or simply not durable enough to withstand the occasional bump or fall. I also found myself constantly switching between my clear prescription glasses and prescription sunglasses, which was incredibly inconvenient, especially when the light conditions changed rapidly. My eyes would often feel strained after long periods outdoors, a persistent discomfort that really dampened my enthusiasm. I needed a single, robust solution that offered both clarity and adaptability, something that could handle diverse weather and lighting without missing a beat. This growing frustration was my primary motivator to seek out specialized sports eyewear.
My quest for the ideal sports glasses led me down the rabbit hole of online optical retailers. I spent countless hours comparing brands, scrutinizing lens technologies, and poring over customer reviews. My search eventually landed me on Cinily Eyewear's website, and that's where I discovered the HDCRAFTER TR90 Sport Goggles. The promise of photochromic lenses and a durable TR90 frame, coupled with the detachable diopter for my prescription, seemed to tick all the boxes. However, my journey with Cinily Eyewear wasn't entirely smooth sailing during the purchase process. While navigating the site, I encountered a few minor glitches, particularly when trying to apply a promotional code. It reminded me of a review I read from a customer named Mary K, who vividly described her frustrations: "Dishonest, doesn't honor promos. Makes it impossible to collect offer when the site is full of glitches. No customer Service 24 hours, no agent. Unprofessional. Will NOT return and I do NOT recommend them. This is the responses of what they offered. Return them ( even though their correct style and prescription. ) to RETURN AND REORDER to get the bogo they messed up and admitted. Simple solution? Credit back to my card used. Nah that's too easy. Attached is an upload of our conversation. Will it be printed? I doubt it. Which is not fair to other consumers." While I didn't face the exact same level of issue as Mary, there were definitely moments of head-scratching when the site felt less than intuitive, especially with discounts. After a bit of persistence and trying different browsers, I finally managed to place my order in early 2024. The waiting period felt like an eternity, filled with anticipation for my new gear.
When the package from Cinily Eyewear finally arrived in my mailbox, the first thing I noticed was its surprisingly compact size. The packaging was simple and functional, a far cry from opulent, but it did its job well, keeping the goggles secure. There wasn't a grand unboxing ceremony, but as I pulled out the HDCRAFTER TR90 Sport Goggles, I was immediately struck by their sleek, athletic design. The black-gray frame looked exactly as advertised, giving off a robust yet lightweight impression. The TR90 material felt incredibly flexible and durable to the touch, which instantly instilled confidence that these could handle the rigors of my outdoor activities. The photochromic lenses had a subtle tint indoors, hinting at their sun-adaptive capabilities. Slipping them on for the first time, they felt snug without being too tight, hugging my face comfortably. The detachable diopter lens was already neatly integrated, and the clarity of my prescription was spot on. My initial impression was one of quiet satisfaction – they looked good, felt solid, and seemed ready for action, perfectly aligning with my expectations for a reliable pair of sport goggles.
Over the past few months of using the HDCRAFTER TR90 Sport Goggles, they have truly become an indispensable part of my active life. The standout feature, for me, has to be the photochromic lenses. Whether I'm starting a run at dawn with low light or cycling through a sun-drenched park, these lenses adapt seamlessly and quickly. The transition from clear to dark, and vice versa, is incredibly efficient, ensuring optimal visibility without any noticeable lag. This has completely eliminated the need to carry multiple pairs of glasses, a convenience I now can't live without. The clarity of the prescription, integrated via the detachable diopter, is phenomenal; my vision is sharp across the entire field of view, free from distortion. The TR90 frame, as promised, has proven incredibly durable and lightweight. I’ve dropped them a couple of times, and they’ve brushed off the impacts without a scratch or break. During intense workouts, they stay firmly in place, even when I’m sweating profusely, thanks to their secure and comfortable fit. These goggles truly delivered on their promise to solve my long-standing eye strain and visibility issues during sports.
Despite the overall positive experience with the HDCRAFTER TR90 Sport Goggles, my initial interaction with Cinily Eyewear's online system, particularly regarding promotions, did leave a sour taste. It wasn't as severe as Mary K's experience, who stated, "Dishonest, doesn't honor promos. Makes it impossible to collect offer when the site is full of glitches. No customer Service 24 hours, no agent. Unprofessional. Will NOT return and I do NOT recommend them." While I eventually navigated the system and got my desired product, the initial friction around discount application and the somewhat impersonal feel of the automated responses made me empathize with her frustration. It felt like an unnecessary hurdle in an otherwise exciting purchase. I also noticed that the photochromic lenses, while generally excellent, take a tiny bit longer to fully clear up in very cold conditions compared to warmer ones. This is a minor quibble, but something to note for winter athletes. Overall, my initial anxiety over the purchase process transformed into genuine satisfaction with the product, though the online customer journey certainly has room for improvement to match the quality of their eyewear.
All in all, the HDCRAFTER TR90 Sport Goggles from Cinily Eyewear have proven to be an excellent investment, certainly exceeding my expectations for performance and durability. Despite a few initial hiccups with the website and applying discounts, the product itself is of high quality and perfectly suited to my needs. The seamless photochromic transition, combined with the precise prescription and robust frame, makes them ideal for any outdoor enthusiast or athlete who requires versatile and reliable vision correction. I would wholeheartedly recommend these goggles for anyone looking for a single, comprehensive solution for their active lifestyle, especially if you face constantly changing light conditions or need durable prescription eyewear. They are truly value for money in 2024, providing exceptional clarity and comfort where it matters most, allowing me to focus on my activities rather than my glasses.
