SCAM Alert: My "Next-Day Delivery" Rip-Off & Ghostly Customer Service ðŸ˜ 

My terrible online shopping experience compelled me to share this, hoping it serves as a cautionary tale. I felt utterly ripped off, charged for "next day delivery" only to receive an email hours later stating my order would take three business days. This place feels like nothing more than an automated business that cares nothing about its customers, a fraud ripping off customers for services they charge for and do NOT provide. I felt compelled to leave this review and engage with customer service because they were failing to provide the service I paid for, and I couldn't get a real person to address it.
Customer: I paid $19.95 for next-day delivery, but my confirmation email says the order will take 3 business days. This isn't next-day at all.
CS Rep: I apologize for the confusion regarding your delivery timeline. Let me check your order details for you.
Customer: Confusion? Your site said "eligible for next day delivery," and I paid extra for it! Iâ€™ve tried calling and using the chat bot, but itâ€™s impossible to get a human to address this.
CS Rep: I understand your frustration, and I'm truly sorry for the difficulty you've experienced reaching us. You are correct, if next-day delivery was selected and not fulfilled, we will certainly refund that shipping fee.
Customer: So, you'll refund the $19.95? And what about my actual order? When will it actually ship?
CS Rep: Yes, I am processing the refund for the next-day delivery fee now, which should reflect in 3-5 business days. Your order is already in process, and we expect it to ship within the 3 business days as per the email. We apologize for the initial discrepancy.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

My last online glasses purchase was a total nightmare! ðŸ˜¤ I paid extra for "next day delivery" only to be told it would take three business days. Trying to get a human on the phone or chat was impossible; it felt like dealing with a fraud that didn't care about its customers. I was utterly frustrated and felt completely ripped off. ðŸ˜­
After such a terrible experience, I was really hesitant to try another online store. ðŸ¤” But I desperately needed new glasses and stumbled upon cinily.net. Their site looked promising, and I was desperate for a reliable place that wouldn't let me down.
What a difference! My experience here was truly fantastic. âœ¨ Just like another happy customer shared, "I had a great experience here with Wesley. He was extremely helpful and adjusted my glasses so now theyâ€™re perfect. They have great prices! I definitely recommend coming, I will be back for my sunglasses and my other prescription glasses!" This perfectly reflects my interaction. The product quality is superb, and the customer service is responsive and human, a refreshing change from my previous ordeal. They made finding affordable prescription glasses effortless. The entire process, from selecting my frames to getting them delivered, was incredibly smooth and efficient. I finally found a place that delivers on its promises and genuinely cares about its customers. ðŸ˜ƒ
