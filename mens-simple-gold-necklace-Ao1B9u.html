Next-Day Delivery Scam: My Automated Customer Service Nightmare 😡

If you're considering shopping online for glasses, please let my terrible experience serve as a cautionary tale. I had ordered from this company twice before without issues, so I didn't understand the negative reviews. However, my most recent order proved them right: this place is nothing more than an automated business that cares nothing about its customers, seemingly a fraud. I paid an extra $19.95 for "next day delivery," which their site clearly stated, only to receive an email hours later saying my order would take three business days. When I tried to get a refund for the service not provided, it felt impossible to reach a human, only automated bots and phone menus that lead nowhere. I felt compelled to leave this review and engage with customer service because customers deserve transparency and actual support, not just automated runarounds.
Customer: I paid for next-day delivery on my recent order, but then received an email saying it would take three business days. Why was I charged for a service that clearly isn't being provided?
CS Rep: I understand your concern, sir. Our next-day delivery option applies to the shipping time after the order has been processed and prepared. There is a standard production time for all orders before they are shipped.
Customer: But your site says "eligible for next day delivery" right at checkout. It doesn't say "eligible for next day delivery after standard production." I paid specifically for that speed, and it wasn't met. I need a refund for the $19.95 delivery fee.
CS Rep: I apologize for any misunderstanding regarding the delivery time frame. I can submit a request to our billing department for review regarding the express shipping fee. They will assess if a refund is applicable.
Customer: So I can't get it resolved now? And it's impossible to talk to someone directly about this? This entire process feels designed to make customers give up.
CS Rep: We strive to provide efficient service through our channels. Your request will be escalated, and you will be contacted regarding the outcome from our billing team.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

I recently had a terrible online shopping experience for glasses. I paid extra for "next day delivery" from another company, only to be told hours later it would take three business days. Getting a refund or even reaching a human was impossible – just frustrating automated bots and phone menus that led nowhere. It felt like a total scam and left me incredibly frustrated and disappointed 😤😭.
After that nightmare, I was really hesitant to order glasses online again. But I still needed new ones, and I was determined to find a reliable place that actually cared about its customers and offered transparency. That's when I decided to give cinily.net a try 🤔.
I found some very reassuring reviews, like one that said: "I’ve been a customer for over four years now and I can truly say with each year the customer experience has gotten better. I don’t even think about looking somewhere else." This really gave me hope.
And what a difference! From the moment I browsed their site, the process was so smooth and intuitive. The product quality is amazing ✨, far exceeding my expectations, especially considering the fantastic value. Their customer service is responsive and genuinely helpful, not automated runarounds. It's truly a breath of fresh air to find a company where you can easily purchase prescription glasses online without any hidden fees or misleading promises. I finally found a place that delivers on its word, and I couldn't be happier with my new frames! 😃
