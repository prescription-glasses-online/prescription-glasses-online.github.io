I decided this was the year to finally give online glasses a try. ✨👓

My trusty old eyeglasses, which had served me faithfully for years, finally gave up the ghost early in 2024. The frame was bent beyond repair, and honestly, my prescription was due for an update anyway. The thought of shelling out hundreds, even thousands, at a traditional brick-and-mortar optical store filled me with dread. I’d seen so many online ads for affordable eyewear and heard friends rave about their experiences, so I decided this was the year to finally give online glasses a try. My main pain point was finding a balance between cost-effectiveness and genuine quality. I wanted something durable and stylish without breaking the bank, and the idea of a simple, straightforward online purchase was incredibly appealing after years of lengthy in-store appointments.
My search for the perfect pair of glasses led me to Cinily Eyewear. I spent hours browsing their extensive collection, comparing styles, materials, and prices. The sheer variety was overwhelming in the best way possible. I gravitated towards the Merrys Design Titanium Alloy Glasses, drawn to their sleek, business-style look and the promise of a lightweight, durable titanium alloy frame. The ordering process itself on the website was fairly intuitive – selecting the frame, inputting my prescription, and choosing lens options like anti-blue ray. However, as I got to the shipping options, I paused. I remember reading some customer feedback about shipping times, and a review from Denise LeFrancois popped into my head. She'd cautioned, "Just so you know, don't bother paying for the faster shipping because you still will have to wait a few weeks to get your glasses. So save yourself that money as it will only get your glasses to you in about 2 days sooner. Not worth that money." Her words echoed my own apprehension about expedited shipping with online retailers. While I was eager to get my new glasses, I decided against the express option, trusting that a few extra days wouldn't make a huge difference, and chose standard shipping instead.
The waiting game began. I’ll admit, there was a mix of anticipation and a tiny bit of anxiety. Would they fit? Would the prescription be correct? About two weeks later, in mid-2024, a small package arrived from Cinily Eyewear. Unboxing was a pleasant surprise. The glasses arrived securely packaged in a sturdy case, which felt quite premium. My first impression of the Merrys Design Titanium Alloy Glasses was overwhelmingly positive. The frames felt incredibly lightweight yet robust, and the design was exactly as pictured online. The TR90 legs were comfortable behind my ears, and the overall aesthetic exuded that subtle, professional elegance I was hoping for. The initial fit was surprisingly good, a testament to their virtual try-on feature or perhaps just good luck.
Now, for the real test: daily wear. I started wearing my new glasses immediately, and I have to say, the vision clarity was exceptional. I opted for the 1.56 Anti-Blue Ray lenses, and I genuinely felt a reduction in eye strain, especially during long hours in front of a computer screen. Denise LeFrancois also highly praised the lens quality, stating, "I didn't really expect too much quality in the actual glasses but I was proven wrong! I am happy to report that they sell quality frames and the lenses are superior to what I have gotten at Lens Crafters! And that is saying a lot! I did pay for the water and fingerprint protection coating and it has proven to be a wise choice!" I wholeheartedly agree with her assessment of the lens quality. I also chose the water and fingerprint protection coating, and it has indeed made a noticeable difference in keeping my lenses clean. They truly feel comparable, if not superior, to glasses I've paid significantly more for in the past. On the flip side, like many online retailers, customer service interaction could be a hurdle. While I didn't personally need to contact them for an issue, I sympathized with Denise's candid remarks: "The customer service is the among the worst I have ever experienced… Don't expect to hear from anyone if you reach out by email. Don't expect to really get help with the 'chat', even though you will be transferred to 'live agent', or so they say. I am not sold on that as truth." This sentiment is something I’ve seen in reviews for many online companies, and it highlights the trade-off for convenience and price. For those considering bifocal lenses, Denise also shared a helpful tip: "They are the only ones to make a Bifocal lens..Not progressive, they also make those, but an actual LINED BIFOCAL, which is my preference. The height of the bifocal is a tad low for me, so still getting used to that. So, if you do order a bifocal, have your eye doctor give the correct height that you can pass on to Glasses USA…..they have a standard height which is NOT for everyone." While I ordered single-vision, this detail underscores the importance of precise measurements for specialized lenses, which is a great piece of advice for future buyers.
Overall, my experience with Cinily Eyewear and my new Merrys Design Titanium Alloy Glasses has been overwhelmingly positive. They truly offer exceptional value for money, delivering quality frames and superior lenses at a fraction of traditional retail prices. Despite some common complaints about customer service and shipping speeds, which seem to be an industry-wide challenge for online eyewear, the product itself far exceeded my expectations. Denise LeFrancois's final note about returns was also reassuring: "Finally, I also read in other review that they only accept ONE glass for return. THIS IS NOT TRUE. I have sent back 3 pairs so far and may not be done until I find the perfect pair for my face. THEY DO REFUND YOUR MONEY ON ALL GLASSES SENT IN FOR RETURN! Just be reasonable and return them within 14 days." This confirmed their commitment to customer satisfaction, providing peace of mind for future purchases. I would absolutely recommend Cinily Eyewear to anyone looking for high-quality, affordable prescription glasses, especially if you prioritize product excellence over immediate customer support or lightning-fast shipping. Just set your expectations right on those fronts, and you’ll be pleasantly surprised by the eyewear itself.
