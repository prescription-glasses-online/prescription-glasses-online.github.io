A Production Nightmare & Customer Service Hell: My Online Glasses Disaster! 😤

My recent online shopping experience has been nothing short of a nightmare, and I'm sharing it as a cautionary tale for anyone considering ordering from this company. Frustrating is the word to describe them – dishonest would be another. They proudly claim 6 days to produce glasses, but I seriously doubt anyone has actually seen them make good on that promise. Their customer service bot is utterly worthless, and I highly suspect there isn't a single human representative available. I placed my order well in advance for an upcoming trip, thinking it would arrive within a few weeks, no problem. Well, that trip has come and gone, and there's still no delivery date in sight. I'm profoundly disappointed that they so blatantly mislead customers about actual production and shipping times, probably because everything is shipped from China. This entire ordeal compelled me to leave this review and try, against all odds, to engage with their customer service.
Customer: I am calling because I ordered glasses weeks ago for a trip that has now passed, and I still have no idea when they will arrive. Your website promises 6-day production, but that's clearly a lie.
CS Rep: I sincerely apologize for the delay and the frustration this has caused, especially given your travel plans. I understand how misleading it must feel when the stated production time isn't met. Let me pull up your order details with your order number.
Customer: My order number is 123456789. And frankly, your customer service bot was useless, so I hope I'm finally speaking to a real person who can actually help.
CS Rep: Thank you for providing that. Yes, you are speaking with a live agent now. I see your order was placed on [Date] and is currently showing as in production with a slight delay. While we strive for the 6-day production, sometimes there are unforeseen delays with specific lens requirements. I am truly sorry that this wasn't clearly communicated or updated on your tracking.
Customer: "Unforeseen delays" doesn't cut it when the trip is over and I've been left completely in the dark. I need an actual date, not just excuses, and an explanation for why your bot provides zero useful information. This is unacceptable.
CS Rep: I completely agree that clearer communication is essential, and I apologize for the shortcomings of our automated system. I'm actively looking into the specific hold-up with your order now. It appears there was a quality check hold, which we are resolving. I can offer you a 20% refund for the significant delay and expedite the shipping once it clears the final check, which I anticipate will be within the next 24-48 hours. You should receive a new tracking update by tomorrow.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

My recent online shopping experience for glasses was nothing short of a nightmare 😤. The company was frustratingly dishonest, claiming a 6-day production time that was clearly a lie. Their customer service bot was utterly worthless, and I doubted any human representatives even existed. I ordered well in advance for a trip, thinking it would arrive easily, but that trip has come and gone, and there's still no delivery in sight. I was profoundly disappointed by how blatantly they mislead customers about production and shipping times 😭.
After that terrible ordeal, I was incredibly hesitant to try another online store 🤔. However, I still needed new glasses and stumbled upon cinily.net. The positive reviews and diverse selection caught my eye, and I decided to take a chance, hoping for a completely different experience.
And what a difference it was! My experience with cinily.net was fantastic from start to finish. Just like one customer raved, "Exactly as advertised, I picked out the exact frames I wanted and waited then got exactly what I order. Unlike blingcharming, the selection offered here was vastly better and more reasonably priced." The product quality is amazing ✨, far exceeding my expectations, and the frames fit perfectly. Their customer service was genuinely helpful and responsive, a welcome change from my previous ordeal.
Finding the perfect pair of prescription glasses online was so easy and smooth. The process was intuitive, and the price was incredibly reasonable for such high quality. I'm genuinely thrilled with my new glasses and the entire shopping experience 😃. Cinily.net has definitely earned my trust!
