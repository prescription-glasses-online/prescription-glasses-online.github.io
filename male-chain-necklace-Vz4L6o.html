Prescription for Peril: My Dangerous Online Eyewear Nightmare! ⚠️

My online shopping experience with this company has been nothing short of a nightmare, and I feel compelled to share my story as a warning to others. They sent me the wrong prescription safety glasses, causing dizziness and nausea. It’s been impossible to get ahold of a live person to actually help get this resolved. After multiple chat sessions, phone calls, and emails with no real help, I knew I had to leave a review and keep trying to reach someone to rectify this dangerous mistake.
Customer: I received my safety glasses, and the prescription is completely wrong. It's causing me dizziness and nausea, I can't even wear them safely.
CS Rep: I sincerely apologize for the discomfort and concern this has caused you. That is certainly not the experience we want for our customers. Can I please get your order number so I can look into this for you?
Customer: My order number is 105XXX789. This isn't just an inconvenience; these are safety glasses! I need the correct prescription. I've tried reaching someone for days.
CS Rep: Thank you for providing that. I see the details here. We definitely need to get this corrected. I understand the urgency, especially with safety glasses. I'm going to initiate a review of your prescription and the glasses sent out immediately. We will arrange for a return of the incorrect pair and ensure a new pair with the accurate prescription is dispatched as quickly as possible.
Customer: So, how long will this take? I can't just go without them. And how do I know the next pair will be right? I'm really frustrated with the lack of communication so far.
CS Rep: I completely understand your frustration and your need for a timeline. Once the review is complete, which typically takes 24-48 hours, we'll expedite the production of your new glasses. We will also assign a dedicated specialist to oversee your order from here to ensure accuracy and provide you with direct updates. You will receive an email confirmation of the new order and return instructions shortly.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap and to highlight the critical need for better customer service when health and safety are at stake.

My last online eyewear purchase was an absolute nightmare 😤. They sent me the completely wrong prescription safety glasses, causing constant dizziness and nausea. It was impossible to get a hold of a live person; after endless chat sessions, phone calls, and emails, I felt completely ignored and frustrated 😭. I just needed someone to rectify their dangerous mistake.
After that terrible experience, I was really hesitant to try another online store 🤔. But I desperately needed new glasses, and I heard some good things about cinily.net, so I decided to give them a shot, hoping for a better outcome.
To my surprise, the experience was fantastic! As one review I saw put it, "Awesome site! Your one stop shop for eyewear. I ordered one pair last month and have already order another this month. Easy site to use and fast shipping. Will be a customer for a long time." ✨ The product quality, specifically for my new titanium prescription glasses, is outstanding. The frames are lightweight and durable, exactly what I needed. Customer service was responsive and helpful, a stark contrast to my previous ordeal. The entire ordering process was smooth and straightforward, from selection to delivery. Cinily.net truly offers great value for money and a hassle-free shopping experience. I'm so relieved and happy with my purchase! 😊
