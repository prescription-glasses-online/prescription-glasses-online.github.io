WARNING: My Horrifying Experience with Wrong Prescription Glasses & Zero Customer Support! üö®üòµ‚Äçüí´

I have to share my absolutely terrible online shopping experience, not just to vent, but as a cautionary tale for anyone considering this company. It all started when they sent me the wrong prescription safety glasses, causing dizziness and nausea ‚Äì it was a truly horrible feeling. My direct conclusion from this ordeal is that it‚Äôs been impossible to get ahold of a live person to actually help get this resolved, despite multiple chat sessions, phone calls, and emails. I felt compelled to leave this review and engage with customer service because I desperately need this issue fixed, and I genuinely hope to prevent others from enduring such a frustrating and potentially harmful situation.
Customer: I received safety glasses with the wrong prescription, and they're making me dizzy and nauseous. I've tried reaching someone for days through chat, phone, and email, but I can't get through to a live person. This is unacceptable.
CS Rep: I am so sorry to hear about the incorrect prescription and the discomfort you're experiencing, as well as the difficulty reaching us. That certainly sounds very frustrating. I understand how critical it is to have the correct prescription for safety glasses. Let me look into this immediately for you.
Customer: It's not just frustrating, it's impacting my ability to work safely. I need these glasses, and I need them right. What are you going to do about this? I just want to talk to someone who can actually resolve this.
CS Rep: I completely understand your urgency and concern. I assure you I'm here to help. First, I want to sincerely apologize for the error and the lack of communication you've faced. To get this resolved, I'll need to verify a few details from your order, and then we can discuss options for a swift replacement with the correct prescription, potentially even escalating this to ensure it gets processed immediately.
Customer: Okay, finally, someone who sounds like they can help. Let's do it. What do you need from me?
CS Rep: Thank you for giving me the opportunity to assist. Could you please provide your order number or the email address associated with your purchase?
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.
