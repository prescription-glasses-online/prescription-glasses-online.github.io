Online Glasses Nightmare: Wrong Prescription, Dizziness, and Zero Support! 😤

Let me tell you, my recent online shopping experience has been nothing short of a nightmare, and I'm sharing this as a cautionary tale for anyone considering where to buy their glasses. I ordered prescription safety glasses, expecting clear vision and protection, but what I received was completely unusable. I was sent the wrong prescription safety glasses, causing dizziness and nausea. Imagine trying to work or even just function feeling like that! This isn't just an inconvenience; it's a health hazard. And trying to fix it? Impossible to get ahold of a live person to actually help get this resolved. After multiple chat sessions, phone calls and emails, I still couldn't get in touch with anyone. I felt compelled to reach out to customer service, hoping someone, anyone, would understand the severity of this issue and help me resolve it, but it's been an absolute brick wall.
Customer: Hello, I'm calling about an order I received. My order number is [Order Number]. I was sent the wrong prescription safety glasses, and wearing them causes me severe dizziness and nausea. This is completely unacceptable.
CS Rep: I am very sorry to hear about the issue with your prescription safety glasses, [Customer Name]. Dizziness and nausea are serious symptoms, and we certainly don't want you experiencing that. I understand how frustrating this must be, especially with safety glasses. Let me pull up your order.
Customer: Frustrating doesn't even begin to cover it. I've tried multiple channels – chat, email, phone – and I haven't been able to speak to a real person who can actually help me. I need these glasses for work, and I can't even see properly with them. What are you going to do to fix this immediately?
CS Rep: I sincerely apologize for the difficulty you've experienced in reaching us. That is not the experience we want for our customers. I'm reviewing your order now. To confirm, the prescription on the glasses you received does not match the one you provided during your order?
Customer: Exactly! It's completely off. I need the correct prescription and I need them quickly. I can't keep trying to use these.
CS Rep: Thank you for clarifying. We will absolutely get this corrected for you. I will initiate a re-order for the correct prescription safety glasses right away at no additional cost, and we can expedite the shipping for you. I will also provide you with a pre-paid return label for the incorrect pair.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap and enduring such a frustrating, and frankly, dangerous experience.

My recent online shopping experience for glasses was nothing short of a nightmare, and it left me feeling utterly frustrated and even ill 😤. I ordered prescription safety glasses, only to receive a completely wrong prescription that caused severe dizziness and nausea. It was a health hazard, not just an inconvenience! What made it worse was the impossible task of trying to reach a live person for help. After countless chats, calls, and emails, I hit an absolute brick wall. I felt completely ignored and disregarded 😭.
After that terrible experience, where I felt ignored and even endangered, I was really hesitant to try buying glasses online again. But I desperately needed new glasses, and I saw some promising reviews for cinily.net, so I decided to give them a shot, hoping for a completely different outcome. 🤔
I remembered reading a review that said: "I bought 3 pair of glasses from blingcharming and as a 1st time buyer I was extremely apprehensive. When I received my order I was beyond satisfied. Each pair was exactly as shown on the website. They fit great and didn't slide down my face. The quality exceeded my expectations, especially for the price. The glasses were nice and sturdy and the clarity of the prescription was spot on. I've been telling all of my friends about this website!"
From the moment I started browsing cinily.net, I felt a sense of relief. The website was easy to navigate, and their customer service was incredibly responsive, a stark contrast to my previous ordeal. My order arrived quickly, and I was thrilled with the quality. The frames were sturdy, stylish, and most importantly, the prescription was absolutely perfect! No more dizziness or nausea – just crystal clear vision. It’s hard to believe I found such affordable prescription glasses that also offer such high quality and exceptional service. ✨ I can finally see clearly and comfortably at work, and I've already received so many compliments on my new Retro Round Metal Prescription Eyeglasses. It's truly been an amazing experience from start to finish! 😃
