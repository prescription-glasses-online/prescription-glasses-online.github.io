Online Shopping Nightmare: Dishonest Promos & Absurd Solutions! 😡🚨

Let me tell you about my absolutely terrible online shopping experience, hoping it serves as a cautionary tale for others. I encountered a company that was utterly dishonest and refused to honor promos. Their site was full of glitches, making it impossible to collect the offer. To make matters worse, there's no 24-hour customer service or even a live agent, which is completely unprofessional. They messed up, admitted it, but their solution? To return my correct style and prescription items just to reorder them to get the discount they failed to apply! A simple credit back to my card would have been too easy for them. This whole ordeal felt incredibly unfair, and it’s why I felt compelled to reach out to customer service and now leave this review.
Customer: I'm really frustrated. Your website glitches prevented me from applying a promo, and now it seems I won't get the offer.
CS Rep: I apologize for the trouble you've experienced with our website and the promotion. Can you please provide your order number so I can look into this for you?
Customer: It's [Order Number]. The issue is, your team admitted the mistake, but the only solution offered was for me to return my perfectly good glasses and reorder them just to get the discount. That's ridiculous!
CS Rep: I understand your frustration with that solution. Our system is set up to apply promotions upon initial checkout, and for a post-purchase correction, a return and reorder is typically the process.
Customer: A simple credit to my card would resolve this immediately. Why make me go through the hassle of returning and reordering for your mistake? It's your company that's been dishonest about honoring the promo.
CS Rep: I hear your concern about the inconvenience, and I want to find a resolution. While a direct credit isn't standard, let me check if there's an exceptional workaround for this specific situation with the system glitches.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap with this company's unprofessional practices and lack of genuine customer support.

My last online shopping experience was an absolute nightmare 😤. I dealt with a company that was incredibly dishonest, refusing to honor promos because their site was riddled with glitches, making it impossible to apply the discount. And don't even get me started on their customer service – non-existent 24/7 support and no live agents! When they finally acknowledged their mistake, their "solution" was outrageous: return my perfectly good, correct style and prescription items just to reorder them to get the discount they failed to apply! A simple credit back to my card? Too easy for them, apparently. It felt so incredibly unfair 😭.
After that frustrating ordeal, I was really hesitant to trust any online eyewear store again. But I desperately needed new glasses, and I was looking for a company that genuinely values its customers and provides a seamless experience, unlike my previous encounter 🤔. That's when I decided to give cinily.net a try, hoping for a completely different outcome.
I saw a review that gave me confidence: "Received my order fast, I am very satisfied with the quality and service." And I can confidently say, cinily.net absolutely delivered! From the moment I browsed their site, the experience was smooth and user-friendly. Their product quality is fantastic ✨, especially for the price. I found exactly what I needed without any glitches or hassles. I was specifically looking to purchase prescription glasses online, and cinily.net exceeded my expectations. The customer service, when I had a small question, was responsive and helpful, a stark contrast to my last experience. It’s such a relief to find a company that actually cares about its customers. 😃
