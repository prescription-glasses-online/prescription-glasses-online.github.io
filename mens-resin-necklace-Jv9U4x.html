Warning! My Nightmare Online Glasses Order: Invalid Tracking & Zero Support ðŸ˜¡

Please be cautious when ordering from here. I felt compelled to share my terrible online shopping experience, hoping it serves as a warning. I ordered my glasses on June 8 and received an email on June 12 that they supposedly shipped. The problem is, they provided me tracking information with a link that, when clicked, brings me to a shipping detail located in Correos, Chile, which is completely invalid. When I tried calling their customer service, there was no option to speak to a live person â€“ just prompts, and the call even hangs up if you press the wrong keys. So, at this point, I don't even know where my glasses are, despite paying expediting shipping fees. I paid $218 to be stuck in this frustrating waiting game with no answers, which is why I finally managed to get through to someone.
Customer: "I'm calling about order [Order Number]. I received a shipping confirmation days ago, but the tracking link is invalid, showing something about Correos, Chile, which makes no sense. I paid for expedited shipping!"
CS Rep: "I understand your frustration, sir/madam. That certainly sounds concerning, and I sincerely apologize for the confusing tracking information and the difficulty reaching us. Let me pull up your order for you."
Customer: "It's been a nightmare trying to figure out where my $218 glasses are. The previous automated system was useless. Can you actually tell me where my package is or if it's even shipped?"
CS Rep: "I see your order details. The tracking indeed looks unusual. I'm going to escalate this immediately to our shipping department to investigate why that incorrect tracking information was provided and confirm the true status of your shipment. We'll also address the expedited shipping charge."
Customer: "Okay, but what's the next step? When can I expect an actual update, and how will I be compensated for this mess and the express shipping fee I paid?"
CS Rep: "We'll follow up directly with you via email within 24 hours with a definitive update on your package's location and status. Once we have clarity, we can certainly discuss appropriate compensation for the shipping delay. Thank you for your patience."
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

It was a total nightmare trying to get my last pair of glasses online ðŸ˜¤. I ordered them on June 8th, got a shipping email on June 12th, but the tracking link was completely invalid, showing some random location in Correos, Chile. I paid $218 for expedited shipping, only to be stuck in a frustrating waiting game with absolutely no answers. Their customer service was a joke â€“ no live person, just automated prompts that would hang up on you if you pressed the wrong button. I had no idea where my glasses were, and I was so incredibly disappointed and frustrated ðŸ˜­.
After that terrible experience, I was really hesitant to try ordering glasses online again ðŸ¤”. But I still needed new glasses, and I was hoping to find a reliable and affordable option. That's when I discovered cinily.net. I decided to give them a shot, praying it would be different.
And what a difference it was! I saw a review that perfectly summed up my experience: "I am leaving a five star review in accordance with the ease of ordering and the virtual help i received online from Nicole, when I had a question. So far so good. I have ordered before and was very pleased with my glasses and Iâ€™m sure I will be again." That's exactly how I feel! The entire ordering process on cinily.net was incredibly smooth and intuitive. The product quality is fantastic, especially for their round prescription glasses. Their customer service was responsive and genuinely helpful, a stark contrast to my previous ordeal. It felt like they actually cared about their customers. I'm so happy with my new glasses and the amazing value I received. What a refreshing experience! ðŸ˜ƒâœ¨
