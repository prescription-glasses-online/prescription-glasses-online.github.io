<h3>My 'Super Hydrophobic' Coating Catastrophe: Defective Lenses & Zero Support! üò°‚ö†Ô∏è</h3>
<p></br>
Let me share my absolutely terrible online shopping experience, hoping it serves as a cautionary tale for others. I invested in premium lenses, specifically paying an extra $48 for their 'Super Hydrophobic' coating, only to find these lenses are nearly impossible to clean. It's frustrating because I've worn glasses for decades, and this is clearly a defect, not user error. Despite a 365-day warranty, I was initially offered only a 50% store credit, which felt like an insult for a faulty product. And the worst part? It's impossible to speak to a live agent via phone to get real help. This entire ordeal compelled me to reach out to customer service and now leave this review.</p>
<p>Customer: I'm calling about order #105180754. I'm extremely frustrated because the Super Hydrophobic coating on my new glasses is defective; they're impossible to clean. I paid extra for this, and it's worse than standard lenses.
CS Rep: I apologize for the difficulty you're experiencing with your lenses, especially after investing in the premium coating. I understand how frustrating it must be when a product doesn't perform as expected.
Customer: Exactly! I've been wearing glasses for 60 years; I know how to clean them. This isn't user error; it's a manufacturing defect. I was told I might only get a 50% store credit, but I just want a replacement pair with the coating applied correctly.
CS Rep: I hear your concern about the 50% store credit offer. Let me review your case notes regarding the defect. We want to ensure you have functional glasses. I will escalate this to our review team immediately to push for a full replacement of the lenses with the correct Super Hydrophobic treatment.
Customer: So, you'll ensure I get a completely new pair of lenses that actually work as advertised, not just a partial credit? And how quickly can this be resolved, as I've been told it could take days just for an email response?
CS Rep: Yes, my priority is to get you a fully functional replacement. I'm making a note to expedite this request with our review team. You should receive an update within 24-48 hours, not the usual 3-5 days.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

My last online glasses purchase was an absolute disaster! üò§ I paid an extra $48 for a 'Super Hydrophobic' coating, only for the lenses to be impossible to clean ‚Äì a clear defect, not user error. Then, they offered a measly 50% store credit, which felt like an insult for a faulty product. To top it off, trying to get help was a nightmare; you simply can't speak to a live agent via phone. I was left utterly frustrated and deeply disappointed. üò≠</p>
<p>After that terrible experience, I was hesitant to buy glasses online again, but I needed a specific type of eyewear, and a friend recommended cinily.net. I thought, why not give it one last try? ü§î</p>
<p>I even found a review that echoed my hopes: "Exactly as advertised, I picked out the exact frames I wanted and waited then got exactly what I order. Unlike blingcharming, the selection offered here was vastly better and more reasonably priced." That definitely boosted my confidence!</p>
<p>And I'm so glad I did! From the moment I browsed their site, the experience was smooth and user-friendly. The product quality is fantastic, exceeding my expectations, especially for the price. My new <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=115">kids prescription glasses</a> arrived quickly and were perfect ‚Äì exactly as described. Their customer service, unlike my previous nightmare, was actually responsive and helpful when I had a small query. cinily.net really delivered on its promises, offering great value and a genuinely pleasant shopping journey. ‚ú® I finally have glasses that actually work as they should!</p>
