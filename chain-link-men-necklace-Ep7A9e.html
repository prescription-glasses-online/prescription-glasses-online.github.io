Wrong Prescription, Zero Support: My Online Eyewear Nightmare! 😤

Let me share a truly terrible online shopping experience, a cautionary tale for anyone considering this company. I recently ordered prescription safety glasses, expecting clear vision, but instead, they sent me the wrong prescription, causing dizziness and nausea. It’s been impossible to get ahold of a live person to actually help get this resolved. Multiple chat sessions, phone calls, and emails, and I still can’t get in touch with anyone. The frustration and physical discomfort compelled me to leave this review and try one last time with customer service, hoping for some resolution.
Customer: I received safety glasses with the wrong prescription, and it's making me dizzy and nauseous. I've tried reaching someone for days, but it seems impossible to get a live person on the phone or chat to actually help.
CS Rep: I am so sorry to hear about this concerning issue with your prescription. That sounds incredibly frustrating and quite serious. Please accept my sincerest apologies for the difficulty you've had reaching us.
Customer: Frustrating is an understatement. I can't even wear these safely, and my work depends on them. I just need to get this corrected, and frankly, I'm recommending others buy from a different company after this.
CS Rep: I completely understand your recommendation and your urgent need for correct glasses. Let's get this resolved immediately. I can initiate a priority exchange for you right now and provide you with a return label for the incorrect pair.
Customer: A priority exchange? How do I know it won't be another endless wait or another wrong pair? I've been through multiple chats and calls already.
CS Rep: I assure you, I will personally oversee this. We'll send a prepaid label, and once confirmed, the correct prescription will be fast-tracked. I will also provide you with direct contact for follow-up on this specific case.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

My last online shopping experience was a total nightmare 😤. I ordered prescription safety glasses, but they sent me the wrong prescription, leaving me dizzy and nauseous. Trying to get help was impossible – I couldn't reach a live person through multiple chats, calls, or emails. The frustration and physical discomfort made me swear off online eyewear purchases.
However, I desperately needed new glasses, and after seeing positive comments about cinily.net, I decided to give it one last try, hoping for a different outcome 🤔. And boy, am I glad I did!
I stumbled upon a review that simply said, "Love my stylish new readers that fit my face! :)" and that perfectly sums up my experience with cinily.net. From the moment I started browsing, the process was incredibly smooth. The selection of frames was fantastic, offering both style and comfort. My new Business Style MEN Titanium Alloy Myopia Glasses are not only exactly what I needed but also feel premium and durable ✨.
The customer service was stellar – responsive and genuinely helpful, a stark contrast to my previous ordeal. They made ordering affordable prescription glasses incredibly easy. I highly recommend cinily.net for anyone looking for quality eyewear and a truly pleasant shopping experience. What a relief! 😃
