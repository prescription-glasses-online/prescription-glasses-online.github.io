Next-Day Delivery Disaster & Bot-Filled Customer Service Nightmare 😤

Let me tell you, my recent online shopping experience with this company was absolutely terrible, and I feel compelled to share it as a cautionary tale. This place is nothing more than an automated business that cares nothing about its customers. They are a fraud, ripping customers off for services they charge for and do NOT provide. I paid for "next day delivery" for my glasses, yet my order took days to even ship, let alone arrive. When I tried to reach out, it was an automated nightmare – no human intervention, just bots and endless phone menus. I simply had to demand a refund for the service I didn't receive, and that's why I finally managed to get a human on the line by pretending to place a new order, just to have a real conversation about what went wrong.
Customer: I paid $19.95 for next-day delivery on my order placed on February 18th, and it's now February 24th, and it just arrived. Your site clearly stated "eligible for next day delivery." Why was I charged for a service not provided?
CS Rep: I apologize for the delay you experienced with your delivery. I understand your frustration regarding the next-day shipping fee. Let me look into your order details right away.
Customer: Look, there's nothing to "produce" since these were plano lenses with no prescription. There was no reason for this delay, and frankly, your customer service has been impossible to reach. I want a refund for that $19.95 shipping fee.
CS Rep: I truly apologize for the difficulty you've had reaching us and the miscommunication regarding the delivery timeframe. I see the charge for the express shipping. While standard processing times can vary, I will certainly submit a request to our billing department to review a refund for that express shipping charge given the circumstances.
Customer: "Submit a request"? You're not providing a service I paid for. This isn't a "request," it's a demand. I shouldn't have to chase you for a refund for a service you failed to deliver.
CS Rep: I completely understand your position. Please be assured that I am escalating this directly to ensure it's processed as quickly as possible. You should receive a follow-up regarding the refund status within 24-48 hours.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

From Frustration to Fantastic: Cinily.net is My New Go-To! ✨

And honestly, ever since I started using them, my eyes feel so much more comfortable, even after hours of screen time. But it's not just about comfort; the compliments I've been getting on their unique style are endless! If you're looking to elevate your eyewear game and protect your eyes in style, you simply must check out these Floral Printed Computer Glasses. They've truly been a game-changer for me, blending fashion and function seamlessly.

My last online glasses purchase was an absolute nightmare 😤. I paid for 'next-day delivery' only to wait days for my order, which turned out to be just plano lenses with no prescription, so there was no real reason for the delay. And customer service? Non-existent! Just endless bots and phone menus. I had to trick them into thinking I was placing a new order just to speak to a human about the refund I was demanding. It was infuriating and felt like a complete rip-off 😭.
After that frustrating ordeal, I was really hesitant to try another online optical store. But I desperately needed new frames, and after doing some research, cinily.net kept popping up with promising reviews 🤔. I was looking for a place that actually cared about its customers and delivered on its promises.
My experience with cinily.net has been a complete turnaround. As one happy customer put it, "Awesome site! Your one stop shop for eyewear. I ordered one pair last month and have already order another this month. Easy site to use and fast shipping . Will be a customer for a long time." ✨ I couldn't agree more! The SOOLALA Floral Printed Myopia Glasses I ordered are beautiful and feel high-quality, perfectly matching the product images. The ordering process was incredibly smooth, and their pricing makes getting cheap prescription glasses online a breeze. The customer service, though I haven't needed it much, was responsive and clear when I had a small query before ordering. What a relief to find a reliable place! 😃
