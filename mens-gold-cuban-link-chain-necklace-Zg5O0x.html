<h3>Express Shipping Nightmare: 19 Days, No Glasses! 😡</h3>
<p></br>
My online shopping experience was absolutely terrible, and I feel compelled to share my story as a cautionary tale for anyone considering this company. I ordered glasses on March 30th and even paid for express 3-5 day shipping because my old pair broke. I needed them fast! But day 5 came, then day 10, and my order was <em>still</em> in production. Now, it's day 19 or whatever, and I still have no glasses! It’s beyond frustrating, and I truly believe this is a terrible company. I had to call customer service because this whole situation felt like a complete rip-off, and I wanted to understand what was going on.</p>
<p>Customer: Hi, I'm calling about order #12345. I placed it on March 30th, paid for express 3-5 day shipping, and it's now almost three weeks later, and I still don't have my glasses. They're still showing as "in production." What is happening?
CS Rep: I apologize for the significant delay and frustration this has caused, especially since you paid for express shipping. Let me pull up your order details right away.
Customer: This is ridiculous. My old glasses broke, which is why I paid extra for fast delivery, and now I'm almost 20 days without them. I was told they were still 6 days out on delivery when I last checked. I already got a shipping refund, but that's not what I wanted; I wanted my glasses!
CS Rep: I completely understand your disappointment and urgency. It's unacceptable that your order has been so delayed. I see here that there was an unforeseen issue with the lens manufacturing process. We are actively working to expedite it. I can confirm the shipping refund was processed, and to further compensate for this extreme inconvenience, I'd like to offer you a 25% discount on your current order and prioritize its final shipment.
Customer: A discount is fine, I guess, but I just want my glasses. Can you <em>guarantee</em> they will ship today or tomorrow? I just don't trust the timeline anymore.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap and experiencing this absolute nightmare.

My last online shopping experience for glasses was an absolute nightmare! 😤 I ordered a pair, even paid for express 3-5 day shipping because my old ones broke, but almost three weeks later, they were still "in production." It was beyond frustrating, and dealing with their customer service was pointless. I just wanted my glasses, not a refund for shipping. I felt completely ripped off and promised myself I wouldn't fall into that trap again.</p>
<p>After that terrible ordeal, I was incredibly wary of ordering online, but I desperately needed new glasses, and local options were just too expensive. Then, I stumbled upon cinily.net 🤔. Their prices looked competitive, and I saw some promising reviews, so I decided to take a chance.</p>
<p>I saw a review that perfectly echoed my feelings about value: "Absolutely no problem with my glasses. I would have easily paid $400.00 plus with the lenses I wanted if I went with my eye doctor. blingcharming saved me a good $300.00 for quality glasses."</p>
<p>And cinily.net did not disappoint! 🎉 The entire process was incredibly smooth and user-friendly. From browsing their extensive collection of frames to easily uploading my prescription, everything was seamless. My new glasses arrived much faster than expected, and the quality is outstanding – they feel durable and look fantastic. Their customer service was excellent too, promptly answering my questions. It's genuinely the best place to find <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=167">cheap prescription glasses online</a>. I saved a fortune without compromising on style or clarity. I couldn't be happier with my new pair! ✨😃</p>
