Scratched Glasses, Return Hell: My $372 Online Shopping Nightmare! 😤

My online shopping experience has been a complete nightmare, and I felt compelled to share it as a cautionary tale. I spent $372 on SCRATCHED glasses, and the frustration only compounded from there. I tried for two days just to TALK TO A HUMAN to fix the issue, but had no luck. The "bot" repeatedly sent the return label to an email I never received. To top it all off, after FINALLY TALKING TO A HUMAN, THEY SENT THE WRONG INFORMATION FOR THE RETURN. This ineptitude is at its finest, and I will NOT be buying from them again. My lawyers will have a field day if this is not resolved.
Customer: I am absolutely furious. I spent $372 on scratched glasses, and your system has made returning them impossible. I've been trying for two days just to get a correct return label, and now the human I finally spoke to sent the wrong information!
CS Rep: I am so incredibly sorry to hear about your scratched glasses and the immense frustration this return process has caused. That is absolutely unacceptable, and I sincerely apologize for the incorrect information and the difficulty reaching us.
Customer: Apologies aren't enough. I need this return label immediately, sent to the correct email address this time, and I expect confirmation that it's been sent and received. My patience is completely gone.
CS Rep: I completely understand your urgency and anger. I'm pulling up your order right now to personally generate and send a new, correct return label to your verified email address. I will stay on the line to confirm you receive it.
Customer: This better work. I'm done with this company after this experience.
CS Rep: I truly regret that your experience has led to this decision. My priority now is to fix this for you. I've just sent the label; could you please check your inbox now?
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap of incredibly poor customer service and a flawed return process.

My last online shopping experience for glasses was a complete nightmare, and I was left utterly frustrated 😤. I spent $372 on scratched glasses, and the return process became an impossible quest. For two days, I tried desperately to talk to a human, but the 'bot' kept sending the return label to an email I never received. When I finally connected with someone, they sent the wrong information! I was absolutely furious and swore I’d never buy eyewear online again 😭.
However, a few months later, I found myself needing new glasses, and after some hesitation 🤔, a friend convinced me to give cinily.net a try, raving about their straightforward process. I was skeptical, but decided one last attempt couldn't hurt.
To my pleasant surprise, it was a completely different story! I found myself agreeing with a review I read that said, "There are plenty of nice glasses/shades to choose from and the customer service reps are very knowledgeable and helpful." The website was intuitive, the selection of frames was impressive, and placing my order for affordable prescription glasses online was seamless. My new glasses arrived quickly, perfectly made, and the quality is outstanding ✨. The entire experience, from browsing to delivery, was smooth and professional. I'm so relieved to have found a reliable and trustworthy source for my eyewear. Cinily.net has definitely won me over! 😃
