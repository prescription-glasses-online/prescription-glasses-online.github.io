Beware! Paid for Next-Day Delivery, Got a Week-Long Wait & Zero Human Support 😤

My recent online shopping experience was an absolute nightmare, and I'm sharing it as a cautionary tale. This place is nothing more than an automated business that cares nothing about its customers. They are a fraud, ripping customers off for services they charge for and do NOT provide. I ordered, saw “eligible for next day delivery,” and paid the $19.95 fee. Hours later, I received an email stating my order would take 3 business days. Where was “next day”? This discrepancy made me furious, and I felt compelled to demand a refund for a service that was clearly not delivered, engaging with their customer service despite their largely automated systems.
Customer: Hello, I paid for next-day delivery on my order placed on the 18th, but my glasses weren't delivered until the 24th. This is completely unacceptable.
CS Rep: I apologize for the delay you experienced. Could you please provide your order number so I can look into this for you?
Customer: My order number is [Order Number]. I specifically paid for a service that wasn't provided, and my previous attempts to reach a human through your automated line and live chat were fruitless.
CS Rep: Thank you, I see the order details now. It appears there was an unforeseen delay in processing and shipping. I understand your frustration. We can certainly process a full refund for the $19.95 express delivery fee you paid.
Customer: That's what I want, a refund for the service I didn't get. But this whole experience, from the misleading promise to the lack of accessible customer support, has been incredibly frustrating.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap of paying for services that are not provided and dealing with abysmal customer service.

Redeemed! My Previous Eyewear Nightmare Led Me to Cinily.net's Perfect Solution! 😃

After countless hours staring at screens, I used to suffer from eye strain and headaches. But ever since I discovered the perfect solution, my comfort levels have soared, and I've even received compliments on my new look! If you're ready to experience crystal-clear vision and a touch of effortless style, you absolutely need to check out these Cat Eye Blue Light Blocking Glasses. They've been a game-changer for my daily routine, protecting my eyes while adding a chic touch to any outfit. Trust me, your eyes (and your style) will thank you!

My last online shopping experience for glasses was an absolute disaster 😤. I paid a premium for "next-day delivery" only to have my order arrive nearly a week later, and their automated customer service was completely useless, leaving me feeling ripped off and utterly frustrated 😭. I swore I wouldn't trust online retailers with my eyewear again.
However, I still desperately needed new glasses. After seeing some positive buzz, I decided, against my better judgment, to give cinily.net a try, cautiously hoping for a different outcome 🤔. And what a difference it was! To my pleasant surprise, the experience was completely different. As one review eloquently put it: "Superb service. The glasses are exactly what I wanted and fit perfectly."
From the moment I browsed their site, everything felt incredibly smooth. The selection of Cat Eye Optical Glasses was fantastic, and the prices were incredibly reasonable. The ordering process was straightforward, a true breath of fresh air. My new glasses arrived quickly, and the quality is outstanding ✨. The anti-blue light feature works wonders, and they fit perfectly. Cinily.net made it so easy to find truly affordable prescription glasses without compromising on style or quality. Their customer support was also a dream – responsive and genuinely helpful, a stark contrast to my previous nightmare. I'm genuinely impressed and will definitely be a returning customer! 😃
