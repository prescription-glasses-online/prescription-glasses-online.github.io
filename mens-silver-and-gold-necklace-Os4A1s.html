<h3>🚨 Warning: Paid for Next-Day Delivery, Got a Scam & Zero Support! 😤</h3>
<p></br>
Let me share a warning about my truly terrible online shopping experience, hoping it can save you from similar frustration. I recently ordered glasses, specifically paying $19.95 for "next day delivery" because the site explicitly stated it was eligible. Yet, hours later, I received an email stating my order would take "3 business days." This company is nothing more than an automated business that cares nothing about its customers, a fraud, ripping customers off for services they charge for and do NOT provide. I felt compelled to leave this review and engage with customer service because their actions were dishonest and their support channels were a nightmare.</p>
<p>Customer: I paid for next-day delivery, but my order confirmation says it will take three business days. Where is my next-day delivery, and why can't I reach a human through your automated phone or chat systems?
CS Rep: I understand your frustration, and I apologize for the discrepancy regarding your delivery time and the difficulty you've experienced reaching us. Let me pull up your order for you. Can you please provide your order number?
Customer: It's #123456789. I explicitly paid for a service you're not providing. I need that $19.95 delivery fee refunded immediately, and I expect an explanation for this misleading information.
CS Rep: Thank you for the order number. I see the charge for expedited shipping. It appears there was an unexpected delay in processing which made true next-day delivery impossible for this item. I sincerely apologize. I can certainly process a full refund for the $19.95 shipping fee for you right now.
Customer: So, you admit it wasn't next-day. Just refund it then. This whole experience has been incredibly frustrating.
CS Rep: The refund for the shipping fee has been initiated and should appear in your account within 3-5 business days. Again, I deeply apologize for the confusion and the inconvenience this has caused.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap of paying for services this company doesn't deliver and then struggling with their non-existent customer service.

My last online glasses purchase was a total nightmare 😤. I explicitly paid $19.95 for "next day delivery," only to receive an email hours later stating my order would take "3 business days." Their customer service was non-existent – just an automated bot or an endless phone system that left me feeling completely ignored and frustrated 😭. It felt like a complete fraud, ripping customers off for services they never provided.</p>
<p>After that dreadful experience, I was incredibly hesitant to try buying glasses online again 🤔. But I desperately needed a new pair, and I decided to give cinily.net a shot, hoping for a better outcome. I was drawn in by their wide selection and positive reviews.</p>
<p>And what a pleasant surprise it was! My experience with cinily.net has been fantastic ✨. The lenses are excellent, and the frames are of great quality. In fact, I recently bought another pair of glasses simultaneously from blingcharming, and their lenses were noticeably more blurry (I use progressive prescription). I'm truly happy with my cinily.net experience and will definitely shop here again! The whole process was so smooth, from browsing their stylish selection of <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=123">prescription glasses online</a> to checkout. The value for money is incredible, and their clear communication is a breath of fresh air. It’s a huge relief to find a company that actually delivers on its promises! 😃</p>
