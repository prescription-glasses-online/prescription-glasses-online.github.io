Customer Service Nightmare: Scammed & Helpless! 😤

I'm writing this to warn others about my truly awful experience. What started as a simple purchase turned into a nightmare. They'll gladly take your money, but if you have any issues with your glasses, fixing them seems utterly impossible. The business feels pretty much fully automated, and when I finally got in touch with someone, the experience was shocking. They were extremely rude and ended the call when they thought it needed to be ended, leaving me with no one else to talk to or file a complaint. I felt completely scammed, with absolutely no way to get help. This feeling of helplessness is exactly why I felt compelled to share my story and engage with their customer service – hoping for a resolution, but finding none.
Customer: I'm calling because I've had a terrible experience trying to get help with my glasses. I've bought them from you, and now that there's an issue, it feels impossible to get it fixed.
CS Rep: I understand you're frustrated, and I apologize for the difficulty you've faced. Could you please explain what specific issue you're having with your glasses so I can assist you?
Customer: The issue isn't just the glasses; it's the lack of support. Your system feels entirely automated, and when I finally reached someone before, they were incredibly rude and just hung up on me! I feel completely unheard and scammed.
CS Rep: I am truly sorry to hear that you had such an unprofessional interaction with a previous representative. That is not the standard of service we aim for. Please, let me assure you I am here to listen and help. What exactly is the problem with your glasses that needs to be addressed?
Customer: It's a defect with the lens, but honestly, after being treated that way, I've lost all faith. It feels like there's no way to complain or get proper help, just automated responses and rude agents.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap and experiencing such a frustrating lack of support.

My last online eyewear purchase was a complete disaster 😤. What started as a simple order turned into a true nightmare. When my glasses arrived with issues, getting help seemed utterly impossible. The whole process felt so automated, and when I finally reached a human, they were incredibly rude and just hung up on me, leaving me feeling completely scammed and helpless 😭. I swore I wouldn't risk buying glasses online again.
However, after that frustrating experience, I was still in need of new glasses. I decided to give online shopping one last try, hoping to find a company that actually cared about its customers and offered reliable support 🤔. That's when I discovered cinily.net. I recall reading a promising review that said: "Love blingcharming. On my 5th pair. Great company, selection and service!!" This positive feedback gave me a glimmer of hope.
