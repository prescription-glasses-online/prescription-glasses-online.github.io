GlassesUSA Warning: Incorrect PD & Customer Service Ordeal 😡

My experience with GlassesUSA was a complete nightmare, and I'm sharing it as a warning to others. We ordered glasses for my 12-year-old, excited about the virtual try-on, but he immediately had trouble seeing with them. It turned out the pupil distance (PD) was incorrect because their site simply doesn't prompt you to provide this crucial measurement and assumes a value, which was wrong for my son. This meant the glasses were useless. I felt compelled to reach out to customer service to correct this critical error, only to face an entirely new layer of frustration trying to communicate with an actual person.
Customer: I'm calling about my order, for my 12-year-old. He can't see with his new glasses because the pupil distance is completely wrong, and your site never even asked for it!
CS Rep: I sincerely apologize for the difficulty your son is experiencing and the frustration this has caused you. I understand the pupil distance was not prompted during the ordering process. Let me pull up your order to see how we can resolve this.
Customer: This is ridiculous! We specifically bought glasses for him to see, and now they're unusable because of an assumption made by your system. And it took forever just to get a human on the phone! What are our options to fix this immediately?
CS Rep: I apologize for the difficulty in reaching us. We can certainly arrange for new lenses with the correct PD. To proceed, we will need the accurate PD measurement from you, and then we can initiate the exchange process.
Customer: So, I have to send back the incorrect glasses first, meaning my son will be without glasses again, while we wait for a replacement? This process is already dragging on!
CS Rep: I understand your concern about the wait time. Our policy does require the return of the original item before we can dispatch the replacement. However, I can ensure the re-order is prioritized once we receive your return to minimize the delay. We truly want to ensure your son gets glasses that work perfectly.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap of incorrect measurements and frustrating customer service.

My last online glasses purchase was a complete nightmare 😤. I ordered glasses for my 12-year-old, only to find the pupil distance was totally wrong because their site never even prompted for it, just assumed a value! The glasses were useless, and trying to reach a human in customer service was an exercise in pure frustration. Emails were slow, and I felt trapped in a loop of robotic responses and policies that required me to send back the faulty product before they’d even start fixing their mistake. My son was without glasses for weeks 😭. It was such a disappointing and angering experience.
After that ordeal, I was incredibly hesitant to buy glasses online again 🤔. But I desperately needed new frames and was looking for a more reliable place, especially somewhere that clearly prioritized the customer experience and accuracy. That's when I stumbled upon cinily.net.
I was really encouraged by what I found. For instance, I read a review that perfectly encapsulated my hopes: "It is a very nice eyeglasses website! Various beautiful kinds of frames, affordable prices, quick delivery, and nice service! I changed my lens during the process of my first order, and the service is very nice and kind. They did not charge extra money but gave me a partial refund. It is really an enjoyable purchase." This sounded exactly like what I needed after my previous mishap.
And cinily.net truly delivered! Their selection of frames is fantastic, and the entire ordering process was incredibly smooth and intuitive, a stark contrast to my previous experience. I found high-quality frames without breaking the bank, making them truly affordable prescription glasses online. The customer service, when I had a minor question about my order, was responsive and helpful, unlike the frustrating bots and long waits I faced before. My order arrived quickly, perfectly matched my prescription, and the quality of the frames is outstanding ✨. I'm so relieved to have found a trustworthy place for my eyewear needs. What a pleasant surprise! 😃
