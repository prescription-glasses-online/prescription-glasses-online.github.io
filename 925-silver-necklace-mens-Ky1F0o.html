My old frames had seen better days – chipped 💔, slightly bent 🥴, and honestly, a bit outdated 😩.

My old frames had seen better days – chipped, slightly bent, and honestly, a bit outdated. Every time I looked in the mirror, they just screamed "replace me!" But beyond aesthetics, I was starting to experience that subtle discomfort: the constant readjusting, the slight blur at the edges of my vision as the frames shifted. I knew it was time for an upgrade, something fresh, reliable, and comfortable. I wanted frames that not only looked good but felt like they weren't even there.
My journey to finding the perfect pair led me online. I’d heard about the convenience and affordability of ordering glasses digitally, and after a bit of browsing, Cinily Eyewear caught my eye. Their collection of minimalist yet stylish frames seemed to offer exactly what I was looking for, particularly the GENTLE Eyeglasses Frame. The transparent black design promised versatility and a modern edge. The ordering process itself was straightforward; uploading my prescription was a breeze, and their virtual try-on feature gave me a good sense of how they’d look. What ultimately swayed my decision was their competitive pricing for bifocal lenses, which, as Chuck Raday noted in his review, was "less than any store I visited." That definitely resonated with my budget-conscious self.
Then came the waiting game. Like David Sutton, who expressed frustration about the stated 6-day production time, I also had a specific event in mind when I ordered them in early 2025. I was hoping for them to arrive within a week or two, well in advance of a trip. However, as Michael Oakes, another customer, vividly described, "This place is nothing more than an automated business that cares nothing about its customers. They are a fraud, ripping customers off for services that they charge for and do NOT provide. I ordered twice from them before, without any need to return or exchange, so I never understood the negative reviews. The third time I ordered, their site said “eligible for next day delivery”. That would typically mean “next day”, right? So, I pay for the $19.95 next day delivery fee, pay for my glasses and hours later receive an email stating that “my order is in process and will take 3 business days”. Where is next day? Wait…it doesn’t stop there. I call their toll free line…automated…no human intervention. I try their “live chat”…automated bot. I email both their customer service and returns department asking for a refund of my $19.95 next day delivery fee since it’s clearly not meeting the requirements…crickets. I call their toll free number back and keep going through the menu and trying different options. I try the one that asks if I want to place an order…bingo, I get a human. So I propose my issue to that person and after several moments on hold I get told “I will submit your request to the billing department and it will be up to them”. Ummm, nope…you’re not providing a service that I paid for…refund my money. Agent wasn’t hearing that and ended the call. Horrible business. Horrible customer service. Everything is automated and forces you to interact with a live chat bot or an endless phone system that they hope you’ll just give up on from pure frustration. I will NEVER do business with this place again and will spread this review like the plague. Update 02-24-2025: Order placed 02-18 Label created 02-20 (not shipped as they stated) UPS in possession of package 02-21 Item in transit 02-22 Item delivered 02-24 Not “next day delivery” as their site clearly stated. Nothing to “produce” as the glasses had “Plano lenses” with no prescription so still not sure of the delay in “production” Still would not recommend this company based on their lack of replies to 6 emails requesting help. Their sugar coated response is lack luster and a poor attempt to cover up their extremely lacking customer service. Purchase elsewhere and avoid the issues that so many are having with this company."
Thankfully, I didn't opt for the "next day delivery," but my order still took longer than I anticipated. The tracking updates were a bit vague, and like Michael, I found their automated customer service channels frustratingly unhelpful when I tried to get an update in mid-February 2025. It felt like shouting into a void. This really tested my patience and did dim my initial excitement. However, when the package finally arrived in late February 2025, the initial sight of the glasses immediately uplifted my mood. The packaging was simple but secure, and as I pulled the GENTLE Eyeglasses Frame out, I was impressed. They looked exactly as pictured online – sleek, modern, and surprisingly lightweight. Joshua Lozano rightly pointed out that "Glasses look nice. Good quality for the material." The transparent black was subtly stylish, and the material felt robust, not flimsy. My initial impression was a definite "wow," shaking off the earlier delivery frustrations.
Putting them on for the first time, I instantly felt the difference. The fit was remarkably comfortable, snug without being tight, and they didn’t slide down my nose even when I moved around. As Plantbased Strength (Kyle Wheeler) shared, "Glasses fit well. I can see clearly with them on." This echoed my exact experience – the world snapped into clear focus, and the wide field of vision from the lenses was a joy. The lens quality, despite the potential cost as Joshua Lozano mentioned ("The lenses is where it can get pricey, BUT the quality really shows. I can see why the lenses alone cost the most."), truly stands out. Everything is crisp, and there's no distortion, even at the edges. I wear them all day, from working on my laptop to reading a book, and they remain comfortable. The only minor point of improvement I've noticed, something that Carol Richmond highlighted with her "Super Hydrophobic coating" issue, is that these lenses, while great, can occasionally attract smudges more easily than some older pairs I've owned. It's not a deal-breaker, but I do find myself wiping them more often. However, the overall comfort and clarity far outweigh this minor inconvenience.
Despite the hiccup with the delivery time and the frustrating customer service experience that Michael Oakes so thoroughly detailed, I must say that the product itself, the GENTLE Eyeglasses Frame, genuinely impressed me. For the quality of the frames and lenses, I feel they offer excellent value. Yes, the waiting period was longer than advertised, and their customer support system needs a significant overhaul to be more human and responsive, as many (including myself and Michael Oakes) have experienced. However, once the glasses are in your hands, they truly deliver on clarity, comfort, and style. I would recommend Cinily Eyewear for anyone looking for stylish, high-quality glasses at competitive prices, provided you manage your expectations regarding shipping times and are prepared for a potentially impersonal customer service experience. As Nicole Morfa put it, "They have great prices! I definitely recommend coming, i will be back for my sunglasses and my other prescription glasses!" I might just follow her lead for my next pair, hoping Cinily Eyewear improves their back-end processes by then.
