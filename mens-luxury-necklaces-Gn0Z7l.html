My Online Shopping Nightmare: Dishonest Promos & Glitches Galore! 😡

Let me tell you, my recent online shopping experience was nothing short of a nightmare, and I'm sharing this as a cautionary tale for anyone considering a purchase from this website. It was utterly dishonest; they didn't honor promos, and the site was full of glitches, making it impossible to collect any offer. The lack of 24-hour customer service and direct agent access was simply unprofessional. I felt compelled to leave a review and finally get through to someone because of their ridiculous solution: asking me to return perfectly correct glasses just to reorder and get a BOGO offer they messed up, instead of a simple credit back to my card. It was truly frustrating.
Customer: Hello, I'm calling because I'm incredibly frustrated with my recent order. Your website didn't honor the BOGO promo, and now you want me to return glasses I like, just to reorder them?
CS Rep: I apologize for the difficulty you've experienced with the promotion and our website glitches. I understand how frustrating it must be to not receive the discount you expected.
Customer: Frustrating is an understatement. Why can't you just credit my card for the discount? It seems like a simple solution for a mistake you admitted was yours.
CS Rep: I hear your preference for a credit, and I understand why that would be simpler. Our current policy for resolving promotional issues, especially when an order has already shipped, often involves a reorder to ensure the BOGO discount is applied correctly system-wise. Let me see if there are any other options I can explore for you, but generally, the return and reorder is how we rectify these situations.
Customer: Well, it's a terrible policy. It's not fair to make me jump through hoops for your system's limitations. This whole experience has been unprofessional.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

My last online shopping experience was an absolute nightmare 😤. The website was completely dishonest, not honoring promos and riddled with glitches that made collecting any offer impossible. Customer service was a joke – no 24-hour support, no direct agent access, just utter unprofessionalism. To top it off, they wanted me to return perfectly fine glasses just to reorder them and get a BOGO deal they messed up, instead of a simple refund to my card. It was truly frustrating, leaving me feeling exploited 😭.
After that disastrous ordeal, I was hesitant to try online glasses shopping again, but I desperately needed a straightforward solution. I decided to give cinily.net a shot, hoping for a better experience 🤔. And oh, what a difference!
I found a review that really resonated with me: "I got my order and I couldn't see with the glasses. I had made an error entering the prescription. I was helped politely, quickly, and efficiently. Once I fixed my prescription, they immediately started making my new glasses, before I had even shipped the others back! New ones arrived, and I'm loving them. Not the first time I've ordered, and won't be the last." This level of service is exactly what I needed!
Cinily.net completely exceeded my expectations. The website was smooth, easy to navigate, and the ordering process was a breeze. No glitches, no hidden fees! The quality of their affordable prescription glasses is fantastic, far better than what I anticipated for the price. Their customer support was responsive and genuinely helpful, unlike my previous experience. It's a true delight to find a company that values its customers and delivers on its promises ✨. I'm so happy with my new glasses! 😃
