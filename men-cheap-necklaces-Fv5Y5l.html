My Online Shopping Nightmare: Dishonest, Glitchy & Unhelpful CS! 😡

My online shopping experience with this company was nothing short of a nightmare, and I feel compelled to share my story as a warning to others. This company is dishonest, doesn't honor promos, and makes it impossible to collect offers when their site is full of glitches. There's no customer service available 24 hours, and finding a live agent is a Herculean task. I was pushed to the point of frustration, knowing they had messed up my Buy One Get One (BOGO) offer but refused a simple credit, instead suggesting I "return and reorder" glasses that were already correct. I had to reach out to customer service to try and resolve this blatant unfairness.
Customer: I'm calling because I purchased glasses with a BOGO offer, and it didn't apply correctly.
CS Rep: I apologize for the inconvenience you've experienced with your promotion. Let me look into your order details for you. What is your order number?
Customer: It's [Order Number]. The website clearly showed the BOGO, but it didn't reflect in my final total.
CS Rep: Thank you. I see the promotion wasn't applied. Our system typically requires specific steps for promotions. While I understand this is frustrating, our policy for unapplied promotions is to facilitate a return and then a new order with the correct offer.
Customer: But that's ridiculous! My glasses are already the correct style and prescription. Why can't you just credit the difference to my card? It seems like a simple solution for a mistake that was on your end due to website glitches.
CS Rep: I hear your frustration, and I truly apologize that the process isn't as straightforward as you'd like. Unfortunately, a direct credit for a BOGO offer isn't an option our system allows. We believe reordering ensures the promotion is applied correctly.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

My last online shopping experience was an absolute nightmare 😤. I was completely ripped off, and the company was utterly dishonest. They refused to honor a simple Buy One Get One (BOGO) promotion, blaming website glitches on their end. When I contacted customer service, they offered no real solution, just a ridiculous suggestion to "return and reorder" glasses that were already perfect! A simple credit was too much to ask for, and finding a live agent was a Herculean task. I was left frustrated and furious 😭.
After that disastrous encounter, I honestly thought I'd given up on buying glasses online 🤔. But then, a friend recommended cinily.net, highlighting their transparent policies and customer focus. I decided to give online shopping one last try, hoping for a different experience.
And what a difference! It truly felt like a breath of fresh air. Just like another satisfied customer said, "Superb service. The glasses are exactly what I wanted and fit perfectly." ✨
My experience echoed this sentiment entirely. The quality of my new SHINU Wood Legs frames is outstanding, far exceeding my expectations for the price. The ordering process was incredibly smooth, and their website was intuitive and glitch-free. I was specifically looking for affordable prescription glasses online, and cinily.net delivered exceptional value without compromising on quality or style. Their customer service, though I barely needed it, was responsive and helpful during a minor query. This company truly cares about its customers, and it shows in every aspect of their service. I'm absolutely delighted with my purchase! 😃
