Beware! My Next-Day Delivery Nightmare & Automated Frustration 😤

I want to share my terrible online shopping experience, hoping it serves as a cautionary tale for others. This place is nothing more than an automated business that cares nothing about its customers. They are a fraud, ripping customers off for services that they charge for and do NOT provide. I paid $19.95 for "next day delivery," only to receive an email hours later stating my order would take "3 business days." Where is "next day" delivery? This blatant deception and the impossible task of reaching a human made me furious, compelling me to leave this review and demand answers.
Customer: I paid for next-day delivery, but my order email says it will take three business days. This is unacceptable, and I want my $19.95 refunded immediately.
CS Rep: I understand your frustration, and I sincerely apologize for the confusion and the delay in your delivery. Let me look into your order details right away.
Customer: There’s no confusion, I paid for a service you didn’t provide. I've tried calling and live chat; everything is automated. It's impossible to get a human to talk to!
CS Rep: I'm truly sorry for the difficulty you've experienced reaching us. Our automated systems are designed to assist efficiently, but I recognize that sometimes a personal touch is needed. I've processed a full refund for your next-day delivery fee, which you should see within 3-5 business days.
Customer: So, I get my money back for the shipping, but my glasses still won't arrive as promised. This entire process has been incredibly frustrating.
CS Rep: I understand your disappointment regarding the delivery timeframe. While the shipping fee refund addresses the immediate discrepancy, I truly regret that the initial expectation for "next day" was not met. I've also noted your feedback about our customer service accessibility to our team for review.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

I recently had an absolutely terrible online shopping experience that left me furious 😤. I paid $19.95 for "next day delivery" from another site, only to receive an email hours later saying my order would take "3 business days." It was blatant deception! Then, trying to get a human on the phone or live chat was impossible; everything was automated, and I felt completely ripped off for a service that was never provided. I was so frustrated and disappointed 😭.
After that ordeal, I was really hesitant to trust another online store for my eyewear. But I still needed new glasses, so after some careful research and looking for a company that truly values its customers, I decided to give cinily.net a try 🤔. And I'm so glad I did!
As one reviewer mentioned, "My glasses and my mom's I really liked them, they are very affordable and you can get very stylish stuff."
My experience echoed that positivity. Right from browsing their extensive collection, I felt optimistic. I found exactly what I needed at fantastic prices. Their website was so easy to navigate, and the whole process was incredibly smooth. Their selection of prescription glasses is truly impressive, offering so many stylish and affordable options. The quality of my new glasses is fantastic – they fit perfectly and look great ✨. Cinily.net has definitely earned my trust and future business! 😃
