Customer Service Nightmare: Scammed & Hung Up On! ðŸ˜¡

My recent online shopping experience was nothing short of a nightmare, and I feel compelled to share my story as a warning. When issues arose with my glasses, I discovered that this company is terrible to purchase from. They'll gladly take your money, but when it's time for them to fix a problem, it seems impossible. The business feels fully automated, and when I finally got in touch with someone, they were extremely rude and just ended the call when they felt like it. It felt like I was being scammed, with no way to get help or file a complaint. That's why I'm here, leaving this review and hoping to get some real answers from customer service.
Customer: I'm calling because I'm absolutely furious with the service I've received. I've had an issue with my recent order, and trying to get it resolved has been a complete nightmare.
CS Rep: I understand you're upset, and I apologize for the frustration you've experienced. Could you please explain what happened with your order so I can assist you?
Customer: I've tried multiple times already. I feel like this business is fully automated, and when I finally managed to get through to someone earlier, they were extremely rude and just ended the call when they felt like it. I feel like I'm being scammed, with no one to actually help or even file a complaint with!
CS Rep: I'm truly sorry to hear that you had such a negative interaction; that is certainly not the experience we want for our customers. Please know that I'm here to listen and help you now. Can you tell me more about the issue with your glasses? We want to ensure this is resolved for you.
Customer: My glasses arrived incorrectly, and I've been trying to get them exchanged or fixed, but it's been an endless loop of frustration and unhelpful responses. I just want my problem fixed without feeling like I'm being dismissed.
CS Rep: I understand completely. Let's get this sorted out. To start, could you please provide your order number? I will personally review your previous interactions and ensure we find a suitable resolution for your incorrect glasses today.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap of feeling ignored and scammed.

My last online shopping experience was an absolute nightmare, and I'm still fuming just thinking about it ðŸ˜¤. When issues arose with my glasses, the company was terrible to deal with. They'd take my money gladly, but fixing a problem seemed impossible. The whole business felt automated, and when I finally reached a human, they were extremely rude and hung up on me! It truly felt like a scam, with no one to help or even file a complaint with. I was so disappointed and frustrated ðŸ˜­.
After that terrible ordeal, I was really hesitant to try another online store, but I desperately needed new glasses. After some searching, I decided to give cinily.net a shot, hoping for a completely different experience ðŸ¤”.

Their range of affordable prescription glasses made me feel like I was getting true value without any of the previous headaches. I finally found a reliable place for my eyewear needs! ðŸ˜ƒ
