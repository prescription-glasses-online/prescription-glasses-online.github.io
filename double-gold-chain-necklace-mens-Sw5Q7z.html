<h3>Beware! My $347 Gone, Zero Refund & Useless Customer Service! ðŸ˜¡</h3>
<p></br>
It's with deep regret and immense frustration that I share my absolutely terrible online shopping experience, hoping it serves as a cautionary tale for others. My experience can only be described as a total waste of $347, and I feel compelled to warn potential buyers: buy at your own risk. I followed their 14-day return policy to the letter, used their return authorization within the time limit, and shipped the glasses back via UPS at their recommendation. Yet, despite all this, there has been no credit or any contact of any kind from them. Their customer service is horrible; thereâ€™s no phone number that connects, only a robot chat session that leads to circular frustration. I needed to know what happened to my return and my money, which is why I tried to engage with their customer service and now leave this review.</p>
<p>Customer: I returned my glasses weeks ago, following your policy and shipping instructions, and I still haven't received my $347 credit. What is going on?
CS Rep: I understand your frustration, and I sincerely apologize for the delay and lack of communication. Can you please provide your order number and the tracking number for your return shipment?
Customer: My order number is 123456789 and the UPS tracking shows it was delivered days ago. Why is this so hard? I just want my money back!
CS Rep: Thank you for that information. I am looking into your order and the return status now. Please allow me a moment to investigate this for you in our system.
Customer: This whole process has been infuriating. Your bot is useless, and I can't even talk to a human! I just want to know when I'll see my refund.
CS Rep: I deeply apologize for the difficulty you've experienced reaching us and with our automated system. I'm actively checking the status of your refund and will get back to you with an update as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

My previous online glasses shopping experience was nothing short of a nightmare ðŸ˜¤. I'm still reeling from the frustration of losing $347 and getting absolutely no resolution. I meticulously followed their 14-day return policy, shipped the glasses back with their authorization, and even used their recommended UPS service. Yet, weeks later, no credit, no contact. Their 'customer service' was a joke â€“ a useless robot chat that led to endless circular frustration, with no way to speak to a real human. It felt like a total scam, and I was so deeply disappointed ðŸ˜­.</p>
<p>After that terrible ordeal, I was incredibly hesitant to try online glasses shopping again, but I desperately needed new glasses ðŸ¤”. I decided to give cinily.net a shot, hoping for a completely different experience â€“ one that actually valued its customers and provided real service. And I'm so glad I did! My experience with cinily.net has been a breath of fresh air âœ¨. It's truly a stark contrast to my previous ordeal. I've read many positive reviews, and I can confirm the sentiment, like this one: 'I had a great experience here. The team was extremely helpful, and their service ensures my glasses are perfect. They have great prices! I definitely recommend coming, I will be back for my sunglasses and my other <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=123">prescription glasses</a>!'</p>
<p>From the moment I started browsing, the process was incredibly smooth. The quality of their frames is outstanding, and the pricing is incredibly competitive. What truly stands out is their commitment to customer satisfaction. I found their customer support responsive and genuinely helpful, a refreshing change from automated bots. It's clear they prioritize their customers. I finally have a pair of glasses that fit perfectly and look great, and I didn't have to jump through hoops or lose sleep over my money. What a relief! ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
