My Online Glasses Nightmare: A Warning of Endless Downgrades & Rip-offs! 😤😡

Let me tell you about my absolutely terrible online shopping experience, hoping it serves as a warning for others. This place is the worst! I purchased glasses with an added warranty, and when the frame broke, initiating a replacement turned into a nightmare. Each time I've needed a lens replacement, they claim my choice of frame is out of stock, forcing me into a store credit plus a small percentage. This means I end up with a cheaper and lighter pair than the previous, all while decreasing the value of my order from $189 down to around $130. It feels like a total joke and robbery. I felt compelled to leave a review and engage with customer service because they haven't gotten a single order right, and I'm tired of dealing with this crap from them.
Customer: I'm calling about my replacement order. This is unacceptable. My frame broke, and you're telling me my original frame is out of stock, so I'm getting a cheaper, lighter pair and a store credit? Plus a $30 deductible?
CS Rep: I understand your frustration, and I'm truly sorry to hear about the issues with your replacement, sir/ma'am. Let me pull up your order details immediately to see what we can do.
Customer: This isn't the first time. You haven't got one order right since I started purchasing from you. My initial $189 order is now being replaced with something valued at $130. It feels like a complete rip-off.
CS Rep: I sincerely apologize for this repeated negative experience and the feeling of being shortchanged. That's definitely not the service we aim to provide. I see the notes about the frame being unavailable. Let me explore all options to find a comparable replacement at no additional cost to you, and discuss waiving that deductible.
Customer: I just want a quality replacement that matches what I originally paid for, not a continuous downgrade with extra fees.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap and experiencing this endless cycle of disappointment and devaluing.

My last online glasses purchase was an absolute nightmare! 😤 I bought a pair with a warranty, but when the frame broke, getting a replacement turned into an endless cycle of frustration. Each time, they claimed my chosen frame was out of stock, forcing me into cheaper, lighter alternatives with store credit. My initial $189 order kept getting devalued to about $130 – it felt like a total rip-off and a joke! 😭 Customer service was unhelpful, and I was utterly exhausted by the disappointment.
After such a dreadful experience, I was incredibly hesitant to try buying glasses online again 🤔. However, I desperately needed new eyewear, and after seeing positive comments about cinily.net, I decided to give them a chance, hoping for a completely different outcome.
I stumbled upon a review that really resonated with me: "Very pleased with my glasses. I only have single vision lenses, and with anti-glare the price was excellent. Other retail stores like blingcharming wanted twice the price and without anti-glare. The virtual try-on was so helpful. I would definitely order glasses again online with this site!" ✨
And I'm so glad I did! My experience with cinily.net has been outstanding. Their website is easy to navigate, and the customer service was genuinely attentive and supportive, a stark contrast to my previous ordeal. The cheap prescription glasses online I received are of fantastic quality, especially considering the price. I finally have a quality replacement that matches what I originally paid for, without any hidden fees or downgrades! My new pair is perfect, and I couldn't be happier. I wholeheartedly recommend cinily.net for anyone looking for reliable and affordable eyewear! 😃👓
