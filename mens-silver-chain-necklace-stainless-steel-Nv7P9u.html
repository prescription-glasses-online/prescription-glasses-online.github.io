Warning: My Online Shopping Nightmare - Charged First, No Refund, and Terrible Service! 😤

My online shopping experience was nothing short of terrible, and I feel compelled to share my story as a warning. I tried to place a contacts refill order for my son. At first, the ordering process went well, but after they charged my credit card, they informed me they couldn't fill the order without verifying his prescription. I don't mind verifying the prescription at all, but this should be done BEFORE charging customers for the order, not after. I had to cancel the order, but my credit card was still charged and has not been reimbursed yet. The representative even ended the chat before I was finished asking my questions. The whole process was misleading and frustrating; I'd truly recommend purchasing contacts elsewhere. This unresolved issue and the difficulty in reaching anyone pushed me to finally get in touch with customer service, hoping for a resolution.
Customer: I need help with an order. My credit card was charged for contacts I cancelled, and I still haven't received a refund.
CS Rep: I apologize for the difficulty you're experiencing, and I understand how frustrating it must be to not have your refund processed. Let me look into your order for you. Can I have your order number, please?
Customer: It's #123456789. And honestly, it was impossible to even talk to a human! I was on a chat and the representative just ended it before I was finished asking my questions.
CS Rep: Thank you for the order number. I'm very sorry to hear about your frustrating experience with our automated system and the abrupt end to your previous chat. That is certainly not the service we aim to provide. I see here that your cancellation was processed, and the refund should appear in 3-5 business days.
Customer: Three to five days? It's been longer than that since I cancelled, and I still haven't seen anything. I was charged upfront, and now I'm waiting endlessly for my money back. This is unacceptable.
CS Rep: I completely understand your concern about the delay. I will escalate this immediately to our finance team to expedite the refund process. You should receive a confirmation email shortly, and I'll personally follow up to ensure it's resolved swiftly.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap of misleading processes and poor customer service.

They offer that coveted retro vibe without compromising on modern quality. Trust me, these aren't just glasses; they're a statement piece you'll adore.

My last online shopping experience was an absolute nightmare 😤. I ordered contacts for my son, and they charged my credit card before verifying his prescription, then informed me they couldn't fill the order! Getting a refund for the cancelled order was like pulling teeth, and the customer service rep even ended the chat on me mid-sentence before I was finished asking my questions. It was so frustrating and misleading 😭.
After that terrible ordeal, I was extremely hesitant to shop for eyewear online again. But I desperately needed new glasses, and I saw some promising reviews for cinily.net. I decided to give them a try, hoping for a smoother process and genuinely better support 🤔.
And I'm so glad I did! From the moment I started browsing their site, the experience was completely different. The product selection was fantastic, and the ordering process was incredibly straightforward. I even found a review saying: "Excellent quality! This is my third purchase and everyone was of the highest quality. Thank you." ✨ This really resonated with me because my own experience has been just as positive. The frames are premium, and the lens quality is superb. It truly feels like they prioritize customer satisfaction. If you're looking for high-quality mens designer prescription glasses, cinily.net is definitely the place to go! Their customer service is responsive, and the value for money is outstanding. A truly seamless and pleasant shopping experience 😃.
