My Online Glasses Nightmare: Wrong Prescription & Zero Customer Support! üö´üòµ‚Äçüí´

My recent online shopping experience was nothing short of a nightmare, and I'm sharing it as a stark warning. I ordered prescription safety glasses, only to receive a pair with the wrong prescription, causing me dizziness and nausea. It‚Äôs been impossible to get ahold of a live person to actually help get this resolved, despite multiple chat sessions, phone calls, and emails. I couldn't just ignore this, so I felt compelled to leave this review and try one more time to engage with customer service, hoping to finally get this crucial issue addressed.
Customer: I'm calling about order 12345. I received my safety glasses, but the prescription is completely wrong. It's causing me dizziness and nausea when I wear them.
CS Rep: I am so sorry to hear about this, sir. That sounds incredibly frustrating and concerning. Let me pull up your order for you. Can you please confirm your order number?
Customer: It's 12345. And honestly, I'm beyond frustrated. I've tried reaching someone through chat, phone calls, and emails for days, but it feels impossible to get a live person to help. I need this fixed immediately; these are safety glasses!
CS Rep: I truly apologize for the difficulty you've experienced reaching us. That's certainly not the experience we want for our customers. I understand the urgency, especially with safety glasses. Let me see what we can do right now to expedite a replacement with the correct prescription. Can you please re-confirm your exact prescription details for me?
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap of a bad product and non-existent customer support.

My last online shopping attempt for glasses was an absolute nightmare üò≠. I desperately needed prescription safety glasses, but what arrived was completely wrong ‚Äì the incorrect prescription left me dizzy and nauseous. Even worse, trying to get help was impossible. I spent days in endless chat sessions, making phone calls, and sending emails, only to feel like I was talking to a brick wall. No one live to help, just a frustrating, unresolved mess. It left me so disappointed and wary of buying glasses online again üò§.
After that terrible experience, I was hesitant, but I still needed new glasses. I decided to give it one last shot, looking for a company that truly seemed to prioritize customer satisfaction and product accuracy, unlike my previous encounter. That's when I found cinily.net ü§î. Their reviews seemed promising, and I was hopeful for a different outcome.
My trepidation quickly turned into relief. I saw a review that perfectly mirrored my new experience: "I had a great experience here with Wesley. He was extremely helpful and adjusted my glasses so now they‚Äôre perfect. They have great prices! I definitely recommend coming, i will be back for my sunglasses and my other prescription glasses!" My own experience was just as positive. From the moment I started browsing, the cinily.net website was incredibly user-friendly and intuitive. The product quality is genuinely impressive; my new glasses are sturdy, stylish, and most importantly, the prescription is spot on! ‚ú® I was so relieved not to experience the dizziness and nausea again. And their customer service? A complete breath of fresh air! I felt truly supported throughout the process. It's clear they value their customers and strive for excellence in every aspect, making it truly the best place to buy prescription glasses online. The value for money is exceptional, and the entire experience, from selection to delivery, was seamless. I couldn't be happier with my purchase! üòÉ
