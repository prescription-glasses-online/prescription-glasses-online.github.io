ðŸš« My Online Shopping Nightmare: Dishonest Promos, Glitchy Site, & Zero Customer Service! ðŸ˜¤

Let me share a truly terrible online shopping experience as a cautionary tale. What I encountered was nothing short of frustrating and unprofessional. I found them to be Dishonest, doesn't honor promos. Makes it impossible to collect offer when the site is full of glitches. No customer Service 24 hours, no agent. Unprofessional. This left me feeling utterly disregarded and compelled to leave a review and engage with their customer service to rectify what they themselves admitted was their mistake, which was a simple BOGO they messed up. Their proposed solution, to return and reorder, when a credit to my card would have been simple, was just unacceptable.
Customer: I'm beyond frustrated. Your site glitched, I couldn't apply the BOGO promo, and now you want me to return my perfectly good, correct prescription glasses just to reorder them to get the deal you messed up?
CS Rep: I sincerely apologize for the issues you experienced with the website and the promo application. I understand how frustrating it must be to go through this. Our current policy for promo corrections often involves a reorder, but let me see if there's another way.
Customer: Another way? A simple solution would be to credit back my card for the discount! Why is that so hard? Returning and reordering is a massive inconvenience for your error.
CS Rep: I hear your concern about the inconvenience, and I agree a credit would be simpler. Let me speak with my supervisor to see if we can bypass the standard return/reorder process and apply a direct credit to your card this once. I appreciate your patience.
Customer: That's all I'm asking for. Just make it right without making me jump through hoops.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap and to highlight the need for better customer service and functional promotional systems.

My last online shopping experience for eyewear was an absolute nightmare, leaving me utterly frustrated and disregarded. I encountered a company that was alarmingly dishonest, refusing to honor promised promotions and making it impossible to apply offers due to a website full of glitches ðŸ˜¤. To make matters worse, their customer service was non-existent, leaving me with no agent and no resolution. Their proposed 'solution' to their own mistake â€“ returning my perfectly good glasses just to reorder them for a BOGO â€“ was simply unacceptable and deeply unprofessional ðŸ˜­. I just wanted a simple credit.
After that terrible ordeal, I was incredibly hesitant to try another online store. But I desperately needed new glasses, and after some research, I decided to give cinily.net a try, hoping for a vastly different experience. ðŸ¤” To my pleasant surprise, it was! I can honestly say, "Love the quick turn around for new glasses. Love them so much!" My order for my child's glasses arrived incredibly fast, unlike the endless waits I'd heard about elsewhere.
The cinily.net website was incredibly easy to navigate, with no glitches whatsoever, making it simple to find the perfect kids prescription glasses. Their customer service was responsive and genuinely helpful, a stark contrast to my previous encounter. The quality of the glasses is fantastic, especially considering the affordable price point. It was such a relief to finally have a smooth, hassle-free shopping experience with excellent value. I highly recommend them! âœ¨ðŸ˜ƒ
