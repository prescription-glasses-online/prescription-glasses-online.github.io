2.5 Hours of Frustration: My Glasses USA Website Nightmare! 😤

I'm here to share a truly awful online shopping experience that I hope serves as a warning to others. Frankly, the "Web site was so messed up it took me 2-1/2 hours to purchase two pairs of glasses." The worst part? "I was not able to type in my prescription and save it to continue my purchase. so I will have to be sent an email so i can type in the information that i already typed in on your silly web site." I am now "not sure I will ever attempt to order glasses from glasses USA ever again. The entire process was so very frustrating and certainly a waste of my time." This frustration compelled me to reach out to customer service, hoping for a solution or at least an explanation.
Customer: I spent two and a half hours on your website trying to order glasses, and your system completely messed up! I couldn't save my prescription. Now I'm told I need an email to re-enter everything? This is absolutely ridiculous!
CS Rep: I sincerely apologize for the frustration and the significant amount of time you've spent, ma'am. That sounds incredibly inconvenient, and I understand you had trouble entering and saving your prescription.
Customer: Inconvenient doesn't even begin to cover it! I typed all that information in once. Why can't your system just work? It feels like a complete waste of my valuable time.
CS Rep: I completely understand your frustration. We truly regret that you experienced this technical issue. I can certainly help by taking your prescription over the phone right now, or I can personally ensure that the correct email with a functional link is sent immediately so you don't have to retype everything from scratch. Which option would be better for you?
Customer: Just get the email sent then, please, and make sure it actually works this time. I'm truly fed up with this whole process.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

I'm still reeling from a truly dreadful online shopping experience where their website was so messed up it took me 2-1/2 hours just to try and buy two pairs of glasses! 😤 I couldn't even save my prescription – they wanted me to wait for an email to re-enter everything I'd already typed! It was a complete waste of my valuable time, and I vowed never to order from "glasses USA" again. The frustration was immense 😭.
After that nightmare, I was really hesitant to try buying glasses online again. But my old pair was broken, and I needed a reliable option. I decided to search for alternatives, hoping to find a site that actually worked and valued my time 🤔. That's when I stumbled upon cinily.net, and I decided to give online purchasing one last shot.
To my absolute delight, my experience with cinily.net was a breath of fresh air! It was genuinely "Amazing and quick customer service, great return policy, and great product." Unlike my previous ordeal, I didn't spend hours wrestling with the website.
The ordering process was incredibly smooth and intuitive, a stark contrast to the "blingcharming" site I tried before. I found exactly what I needed without any glitches, and the customer service was responsive and helpful whenever I had a quick question. The quality of my new Chameleon Glasses is fantastic ✨, and they arrived much faster than expected. Plus, finding affordable prescription glasses online here was a huge bonus! I highly recommend cinily.net for anyone looking for a hassle-free and high-quality experience. They really saved the day! 😃
