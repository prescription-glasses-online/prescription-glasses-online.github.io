EyeBuyDirect: A Glitchy Nightmare & Unfair Customer Service! 😠

My recent online shopping experience was nothing short of a nightmare, and I’m sharing this as a cautionary tale for anyone considering EyeBuyDirect. I found their operations dishonest, making it impossible to collect the promotional offer I was due because their site was full of glitches. What made it worse was the complete lack of accessible customer service – no 24-hour support, no agent to speak with. When I finally did connect, their solution was utterly unprofessional: they admitted their mistake with the BOGO promo but insisted I return my correct glasses and reorder them, rather than simply crediting my card. That’s why I felt compelled to engage with their customer service and now leave this review; their practices are just not fair to consumers.
Customer: I'm calling about my recent order. Your website glitched and didn't apply the buy-one-get-one promo, even though I qualified.
CS Rep: I apologize for the technical issue you experienced. Can you please provide your order number so I can look into this for you?
Customer: Yes, it's [Order Number]. And now you're telling me I have to return these glasses I like and reorder them just to get the discount? That's ridiculous.
CS Rep: I understand your frustration. For promotional adjustments like BOGO offers, our system requires a return and reorder to apply the correct pricing. We cannot directly credit the difference to your card for these specific promotions.
Customer: But you admitted it was your mistake! Why should I go through all that hassle of returning and reordering for something that was caused by your website's glitches? Just credit my card.
CS Rep: I hear your concern, and I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this process causes. While I cannot deviate from our policy regarding promo adjustments, I can assist you with generating a return label and guide you through placing the new order correctly to ensure you receive the BOGO offer.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

From Nightmare to Dream: Cinily.net Delivers Exceptional Online Glasses! ✨

My recent adventures have been transformed, all thanks to finally finding eyewear that keeps up with my active lifestyle. The clarity, the comfort, and the seamless transition from bright sun to shade have truly elevated every moment. If you're looking to enhance your performance and protect your eyes with ultimate versatility, these HDCRAFTER Prescription Sport Goggles are an absolute must-have.

My recent online shopping experience was an absolute nightmare 😤. Their website was full of glitches, making it impossible to get a promotional offer I qualified for. To make matters worse, their customer service was utterly unprofessional. They admitted their mistake with a promo but insisted I return my perfect glasses and reorder them just to get the discount instead of a simple credit. It was so frustrating and unfair to consumers 😭.
After that terrible experience, I was incredibly hesitant to try another online glasses store 🤔. But I desperately needed a new pair, especially athletic prescription glasses for sports. A friend recommended cinily.net, and I decided to give them a shot, hoping for a much better experience. And wow, I'm glad I did!
Their service and quality are a breath of fresh air. As a first-time buyer, I was skeptical after my previous ordeal, but cinily.net completely won me over. "I bought 3 pair of glasses from blingcharming and as a 1st time buyer I was extremely apprehensive. When I received my order I was beyond satisfied. Each pair was exactly as shown on the website. They fit great and didn't slide down my face. The quality exceeded my expectations, especially for the price. The clarity of the prescription was spot on."
My experience with cinily.net was just as fantastic. The ordering process was straightforward and glitch-free. My new sports goggles arrived quickly, and the quality is exceptional. The frame feels sturdy, and the lenses are perfectly clear with my prescription. Plus, the price was incredibly reasonable! Their customer service was responsive and helpful, making the whole process incredibly smooth. No hassles, no unfair policies, just a great product and fantastic service. I'm genuinely impressed and will definitely be a returning customer ✨😃.
