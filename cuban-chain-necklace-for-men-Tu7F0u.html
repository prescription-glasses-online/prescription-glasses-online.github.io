Express Shipping Disaster: 19 Days Later, Still No Eyeglasses! 😤

My online shopping experience was absolutely terrible, and I feel compelled to share my story as a cautionary tale for anyone considering this company. I ordered new eyeglasses on March 30th because my old ones broke, paying extra for 3-5 day express shipping. However, on day 5, the order was still in production. On day 10, still in production. By day 11, when I called to ask for a shipping refund, I felt like the company just didn't care. They seemed to handle shipping refunds all the time, which tells you something. Even after getting the $10 shipping fee back, my glasses were still 6 days out from delivery. It's now Day 19 or whatever, and I still have no glasses! This abysmal service and lack of transparency compelled me to demand answers and some accountability from customer service.
Customer: I ordered glasses on March 30th and paid for express shipping because my old ones broke. It's now Day 11 and they're still in production! What is going on? I was promised 3-5 days, not weeks!
CS Rep: I understand your frustration, ma'am. I see your order here. There was an unforeseen delay in the production phase. I sincerely apologize for this inconvenience, especially given your urgent need.
Customer: Inconvenience? I'm without glasses! I already got the express shipping refunded because of this mess, but that doesn't solve the fact that I still don't have my glasses! You're telling me they're still 6 days out? This is ridiculous.
CS Rep: You are absolutely right to be upset. I see the shipping refund was processed. I'm checking the current status… It shows they are nearing completion and are estimated to ship within the next 24-48 hours. We're pushing our production team to expedite this.
Customer: "Nearing completion?" After 11 days, possibly 19 total? This is a terrible company! It feels like no one gives a crap about customers. I need my glasses!
CS Rep: I assure you, we do care, and I understand the urgency. I am escalating this again to ensure it ships as soon as possible. Please accept our deepest apologies for this unacceptable delay. We'll email you an update with tracking.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

My last online shopping experience was an absolute nightmare 😤. I ordered new eyeglasses because my old ones broke, even paying extra for 3-5 day express shipping. Days turned into weeks, and my order was still "in production." By day 11, after a frustrating call to customer service where they seemed completely indifferent to my plight, I still had no glasses, and they were still days away! It felt like they just didn't care at all. What a waste of money and time 😭.
After that abysmal experience, I was hesitant to order glasses online again 🤔. But I desperately needed a new pair, and I started searching for a truly reliable company with better customer service and clear communication. That's when I discovered cinily.net, and I decided to give them a try, hoping for a much better experience.
I was also encouraged by positive reviews I saw. For instance, one person wrote, "I love my new eyeglasses! I am a repeat customer."
From the moment I landed on cinily.net, the experience was incredibly smooth and user-friendly. Their selection of frames is fantastic, and the prices are unbeatable! I was particularly impressed with the quality of the product I received – my new glasses are perfect, and the lenses are crystal clear ✨. What a difference from my previous nightmare! The customer service was also responsive and genuinely helpful. I highly recommend them for anyone looking for discount prescription glasses. They truly care about their customers and deliver on their promises. I'm so happy with my purchase 😃!
