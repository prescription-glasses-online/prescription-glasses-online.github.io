Ripped Off & Disappointed: My Terrible Online Glasses Scam! 😤

Let me tell you about my absolutely terrible online shopping experience, hoping it serves as a warning for others. I was ripped off, and the company is just plain dishonest, making it impossible to collect an offer due to site glitches. They don't honor promos, and their customer service is a joke – no 24-hour support, no actual agents, just unprofessional responses. They actually suggested I return a perfectly good pair of glasses and reorder them just to get a BOGO offer they messed up and admitted to! Seriously, a simple credit back to my card would have solved it, but apparently, that's too easy for them. I felt compelled to share this nightmare and try to get some resolution from their so-called customer service.
Customer: I'm calling about an order where a BOGO promotion wasn't applied correctly. Your website glitched, and I couldn't get it to work, so I missed out on the offer for glasses that are otherwise perfect.
CS Rep: I understand your frustration regarding the BOGO promotion not applying. Our system shows the original order without the discount. What we can do is process a return for your current glasses, and then you can place a new order to ensure the promotion is correctly applied this time.
Customer: So, you're telling me I have to return a perfectly good pair of glasses that already arrived and reorder them, just because your website had a glitch and you admitted to the mistake? Why can't you just credit the difference back to my card? That's a simple solution.
CS Rep: I apologize for the inconvenience this causes. Unfortunately, our system doesn't allow for a direct credit of promotional discounts after an order has been completed without the discount. The standard procedure for such cases is indeed to facilitate a return and reorder to ensure the promotional terms are met.
Customer: This is ridiculous and incredibly unprofessional. I'm not going through the hassle of returning and reordering due to your company's error. Isn't there any other way to resolve this without me having to jump through hoops?
CS Rep: I truly regret that our policy on promotions is causing you such difficulty. While a return and reorder is our primary method for rectifying this, I can escalate your concern to a supervisor to see if any alternative solutions can be explored, though I cannot guarantee a different outcome based on our standard procedures.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap of dishonest promos and non-existent customer service.

My last online shopping experience was an absolute nightmare 😤. I was trying to get a simple BOGO offer, but their website was so glitchy it was impossible to apply, and the company was just plain dishonest. When I reached out to customer service, they suggested I return a perfectly good pair of glasses and reorder them just to get the discount they messed up and admitted to! Seriously, a simple credit back to my card would have solved it, but apparently, that's too easy for them 😭. Their support was unprofessional, with no actual agents available when you needed them. It left me feeling completely ripped off and frustrated.
After that disaster, I was incredibly hesitant to try online glasses shopping again 🤔. I needed new glasses, but I couldn't risk another experience like that. I heard about cinily.net through a friend and decided to give them a shot, hoping for a smoother, more reliable process this time. I was looking for a company that actually values its customers and their time. And what a difference! Just like I read in another review: "I’ve had a great experience working with Zaida for our blingcharming glasses purchase. She’s incredibly responsive, friendly, and always attentive to our needs. Her knowledge of the different models is impressive, and it’s always a pleasure talking with her. I trust that she always has our best interest in mind and offers us the best options. Highly recommend!"
My experience with cinily.net has been nothing short of fantastic! From the moment I browsed their site, the process was seamless and intuitive. The product quality of my new "Thom Brand Design Eyeglasses" is excellent – far better than I expected for the price. The frames feel sturdy and the lenses are perfectly crafted. Their customer service, unlike my previous experience, was genuinely helpful and responsive, addressing my questions quickly and politely. It’s clear they focus on delivering a smooth and satisfying experience. I was looking for affordable prescription glasses online, and Cinily.net truly delivered on that promise without compromising on quality or service ✨. I'm so relieved to have found a trustworthy online option for my eyewear needs. Highly recommend! 😃
