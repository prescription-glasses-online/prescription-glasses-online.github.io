My $372 Nightmare: Scratched Glasses & Customer Service Disaster 😤

My online shopping experience has been nothing short of a nightmare, and I'm sharing this as a warning to others. I spent $372 on glasses that arrived SCRATCHED, and trying to get this resolved has been an exercise in sheer ineptitude. For two days, I tried to talk to a human to fix the issue, but there was no luck. The "bot" just kept sending the return label to an email I never received! I felt compelled to leave this review and insist on speaking with someone because, after finally reaching a human, they sent me the wrong information for the return. It's a colossal waste of my time and money.
Customer: I finally got through to someone, and after all that hassle, the return information you sent me is completely wrong! This is unbelievable. I spent $372 on scratched glasses, and I've been trying to get a return label for days, but your bot keeps failing. Now this?
CS Rep: I understand how frustrating this must be, and I sincerely apologize for the incorrect information and the difficulty you've experienced in reaching us. Let me quickly verify your order details and see what went wrong with the return label.
Customer: Yes, please do. This whole process has been a mess. I never even received the initial return label, and now I have incorrect information. I just want to return these scratched glasses and get my money back.
CS Rep: I see the issue here. It appears there was a mix-up with the return instructions provided. I'm going to immediately generate a new, correct return label for you, and I'll send it to an email address we'll confirm right now. To compensate for the inconvenience, I'd also like to offer you a discount on a future purchase, should you choose to shop with us again.
Customer: A discount on a future purchase? Honestly, after this, I doubt there will be one. Just get me the right return label, to the correct email, this time, and confirm it's sent. This is truly unacceptable.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap of frustration and poor service.

My recent online shopping experience was nothing short of a nightmare 😤. I spent $372 on glasses that arrived SCRATCHED, and getting it resolved was an exercise in sheer ineptitude. For two days, I tried to talk to a human, but the "bot" just kept sending the return label to an email I never received! After finally reaching a human, they sent me the wrong information for the return. It was a colossal waste of my time and money. Truly unacceptable. 😭
After such a dreadful ordeal, I was incredibly hesitant to try another online store for my eyewear needs. But my old glasses were really worn out, and I desperately needed a reliable place with actual customer support. I decided to give cinily.net a shot, hoping for a completely different outcome. 🤔
To my pleasant surprise, it felt like a breath of fresh air! I found a similar sentiment when browsing reviews; as one customer put it, "Purchasing glasses has always been a big task. blingcharming makes the task simpler by being able to try a frame on in your own time and privacy. Easy peasy! Received glasses promptly and seem to be of good quality at much lower costs, 😀"
And I wholeheartedly agree! From the moment I landed on cinily.net, the entire process was incredibly smooth. Their website is easy to navigate, and the range of styles is impressive. I was looking for prescription glasses online, and they delivered on quality without breaking the bank. The customer service, a stark contrast to my previous ordeal, was responsive and genuinely helpful. My new glasses arrived quickly, are perfectly prescribed, and feel sturdy and well-made. What a relief! ✨ I finally found a trustworthy place for my eyewear. Highly recommended! 👍
