Scratched Glasses & Customer Service Hell: A $372 Nightmare! 😡

Let me tell you, my online shopping experience with this company has been nothing short of a nightmare, and I feel compelled to share my story as a warning. I spent $372 on what I hoped would be a reliable pair of glasses, only for them to arrive SCRATCHED. This wasn't just a minor inconvenience; it was a clear sign of poor quality control. What followed was an exercise in pure frustration: I spent two days desperately trying to TALK TO A HUMAN to fix this issue and start a return/exchange. The ‘bot’ customer service was utterly useless, constantly sending the return label to an email address I never received. Even after finally reaching a human, they managed to send the WRONG INFORMATION for the return! This level of ineptitude pushed me to the brink, making me realize I needed to leave this review and try one last time to get a resolution through direct communication.
Customer: Hello, I'm calling about order [Order Number]. I received my glasses, and they are scratched. I've been trying for two days to get a return label, and frankly, your bot system has been completely unhelpful.
CS Rep: I apologize for the trouble you've experienced, especially with our automated system and the condition of your order. I understand how frustrating it must be to receive damaged goods and then struggle to get assistance. Can you please confirm your order number and the email address associated with your account so I can look into this for you?
Customer: It's [Order Number], and the email is [Customer's Email]. I already spoke to someone, and they sent me incorrect return information. I just need a correct return label for these scratched glasses.
CS Rep: Thank you for that information. I see the previous attempt to send the return details. It appears there was an error with the link provided. I'm very sorry for that oversight. I will process a new return label for you right away for the scratched glasses, and I'll send it to the email address you just confirmed. To ensure you receive it this time, I can also read out the tracking number to you, or send it via SMS if you prefer.
Customer: Please send it to my email, and also an SMS. I just want to get these returned and get my money back. This has been a terrible experience.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

My last online shopping experience was an absolute nightmare, and I'm still reeling from it 😤. I shelled out $372 for a pair of glasses that arrived completely scratched, a clear sign of poor quality control. What followed was two days of pure frustration trying to get help from a useless bot, only to finally reach a human who sent me the wrong return information! It was truly infuriating, and I swore I'd never trust online eyewear again 😭.
But I desperately needed new glasses 🤔. After that awful ordeal, I was incredibly hesitant, but I heard good things about cinily.net and decided to give them a shot, hoping for a completely different experience. And oh, what a difference!
Someone once said, "I bought 3 pair of glasses from blingcharming and as a 1st time buyer I was extremely apprehensive. When I received my order I was beyond satisfied. Each pair was exactly as shown on the website. They fit great and didn't slide down my face. The quality exceeded my expectations, especially for the price. The glasses were nice and sturdy and the clarity of the prescription was spot on. I've been telling all of my friends about this website!" My experience with cinily.net was exactly like that, but even better! ✨
From the moment I started browsing for prescription glasses online, the website was a breeze to navigate. Their customer service was responsive and genuinely helpful, a stark contrast to my previous ordeal. The glasses arrived quickly, perfectly packaged, and the quality is outstanding – no scratches, no issues at all! The clarity is spot on, and they fit beautifully. It's such a relief to finally find a reliable place for my eyewear needs. I'm absolutely thrilled with my purchase! 😃
