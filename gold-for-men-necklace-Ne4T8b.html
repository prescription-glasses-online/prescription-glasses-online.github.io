My journey to new eyeglasses üëì always starts with a sigh üòÆ‚Äçüí®.

My journey to new eyeglasses always starts with a sigh. For years, I‚Äôve endured the familiar routine: a hefty price tag at the local optician, limited frame choices, and the nagging feeling that I was overpaying for something essential. My old pair of glasses, a trusty companion for many years, finally gave up the ghost earlier in 2024, suffering a fatal crack near the hinge. This was the final straw. I was tired of feeling trapped by exorbitant prices and longed for a more convenient, affordable solution that didn't compromise on style or quality. I'd seen various ads for online eyewear retailers pop up on my social media feeds, promising designer frames at a fraction of the cost. The thought of browsing from my couch, comparing styles and prices without pressure, was incredibly appealing. It was this desire for a better value and a more modern shopping experience that pushed me towards exploring online options, hoping to find a reputable site that could deliver.
The decision to purchase from Cinily Eyewear came after a considerable amount of online digging. I spent hours sifting through reviews, comparing prices across different platforms, and even "virtually trying on" frames using various websites' augmented reality features. What ultimately drew me to Cinily Eyewear was their extensive collection of frames, particularly the sleek and understated Cinily TR90 Rectangle Frames that caught my eye. They offered a great balance of modern design and classic appeal. While I did see some scattered negative feedback about online eyewear retailers in general, Cinily Eyewear‚Äôs overall positive feedback on quality and customer satisfaction, coupled with competitive pricing, swayed my decision. The ordering process itself was surprisingly straightforward; uploading my prescription was simple, and customizing the lens options felt intuitive. I chose standard shipping, eager but prepared for a bit of a wait, knowing that prescription glasses aren't an instant gratification kind of purchase.
The anticipation of my new glasses arriving was a mix of excitement and a tiny bit of anxiety. Would they fit? Would the prescription be accurate? When the package from Cinily Eyewear finally landed on my doorstep, it was slimmer and lighter than I expected, arriving well within the estimated timeframe. Opening it felt like a small ritual. Inside, the Cinily TR90 Rectangle Frames were nestled securely in a sturdy case, accompanied by a cleaning cloth. My initial impression was overwhelmingly positive. The frames felt incredibly lightweight yet durable, with a smooth, almost velvety finish that belied their affordable price. The black color was exactly as depicted online, a deep matte black that looked sophisticated without being overly flashy. They certainly passed the aesthetic test, exceeding my expectations for an online purchase.
Now, for the true test: daily wear. From the moment I first put on my new Cinily TR90 Rectangle Frames, I was genuinely impressed. The fit was perfect‚Äîsnug without being tight, and they didn't slide down my nose, even after hours of wear. The prescription was spot-on, providing crisp, clear vision that made reading small print and driving at night a breeze. It truly felt like they were custom-made for me. Many customer reviews, like London Hopkins, celebrate "awesome glasses!! got here fast and look great!!" and I wholeheartedly agree. This positive experience stood in stark contrast to some of the more distressing accounts I‚Äôd encountered during my initial research. For instance, I read one detailed account from Michael Oakes, who had a particularly frustrating experience with a similar online eyewear retailer regarding shipping and customer service:
"This place is nothing more than an automated business that cares nothing about its customers. They are a fraud, ripping customers off for services that they charge for and do NOT provide. I ordered twice from them before, without any need to return or exchange, so I never understood the negative reviews. The third time I ordered, their site said ‚Äúeligible for next day delivery‚Äù. That would typically mean ‚Äúnext day‚Äù, right? So, I pay for the $19.95 next day delivery fee, pay for my glasses and hours later receive an email stating that ‚Äúmy order is in process and will take 3 business days‚Äù. Where is next day? Wait‚Ä¶it doesn‚Äôt stop there. I call their toll free line‚Ä¶automated‚Ä¶no human intervention. I try their ‚Äúlive chat‚Äù‚Ä¶automated bot. I email both their customer service and returns department asking for a refund of my $19.95 next day delivery fee since it‚Äôs clearly not meeting the requirements‚Ä¶crickets. I call their toll free number back and keep going through the menu and trying different options. I try the one that asks if I want to place an order‚Ä¶bingo, I get a human. So I propose my issue to that person and after several moments on hold I get told ‚ÄúI will submit your request to the billing department and it will be up to them‚Äù. Ummm, nope‚Ä¶you‚Äôre not providing a service that I paid for‚Ä¶refund my money. Agent wasn‚Äôt hearing that and ended the call. Horrible business. Horrible customer service. Everything is automated and forces you to interact with a live chat bot or an endless phone system that they hope you‚Äôll just give up on from pure frustration. I will NEVER do business with Cinily Eyewear again and will spread this review like the plague. Update 02-24-2025: Order placed 02-18 Label created 02-20 (not shipped as they stated) UPS in possession of package 02-21 Item in transit 02-22 Item delivered 02-24 Not ‚Äúnext day delivery‚Äù as their site clearly stated. Nothing to ‚Äúproduce‚Äù as the glasses had ‚ÄúPlano lenses‚Äù with no prescription so still not sure of the delay in ‚Äúproduction‚Äù Still would not recommend this company based on their lack of replies to 6 emails requesting help. Their sugar coated response is lack luster and a poor attempt to cover up their extremely lacking customer service. Purchase elsewhere and avoid the issues that so many are having with this company."
While I empathize with Michael‚Äôs frustrating experience and acknowledge that delivery and customer service issues can happen with any online retailer, my personal encounter with Cinily Eyewear was, fortunately, the complete opposite. My order processed quickly, shipped promptly, and arrived without any hitches, and I didn't need to interact with customer service beyond the automated updates. The lightweight TR90 material is a dream ‚Äì I often forget I'm even wearing them, which is a significant improvement over my heavier old frames. Cleaning them is easy, and they haven't shown any signs of wear or scratches despite daily use since I got them in early 2024. The optical clarity is excellent, and the anti-glare coating works wonderfully, making computer work much more comfortable. My only minor suggestion for improvement would be to offer even more detailed virtual try-on options, perhaps with a more robust facial recognition feature, but this is a minor quibble for an otherwise stellar product.
All in all, my experience with Cinily Eyewear, particularly with my new Cinily TR90 Rectangle Frames, has been nothing short of fantastic. They were truly "1/4 of the price of my local optometrist" as Garrett D. noted in their review, and the quality certainly doesn‚Äôt feel compromised. I received high-quality eyeglasses that fit perfectly, look great, and provide excellent vision, all delivered efficiently. I would absolutely recommend Cinily Eyewear, especially for anyone looking for a cost-effective alternative to traditional optical shops without sacrificing style or functionality. If you're tired of overpaying and want the convenience of shopping from home, their selection and service (at least in my case) are truly worth checking out. It felt like a win-win situation, and I couldn't be happier with my new eyewear.
