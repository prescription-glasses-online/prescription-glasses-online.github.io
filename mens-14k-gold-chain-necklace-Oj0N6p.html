<h3>Warning: Don't Fall for Their "Next-Day Delivery" Scam! ðŸ˜ </h3>
<p></br>
Let me tell you about my terrible online shopping experience, which I hope serves as a warning to others. This place is nothing more than an automated business that cares nothing about its customers. They are a fraud, ripping customers off for services they charge for and do NOT provide. I felt compelled to leave this review and engage with their customer service because I was completely ripped off after paying $19.95 for "next day delivery," only to receive an email hours later stating my order would take "3 business days." My glasses even had "Plano lenses," so there was no legitimate "production" delay, yet I still waited. When I tried to get a refund, it was an absolute nightmare of automated systems and unhelpful responses.</p>
<p>Customer: I need a refund for the $19.95 next day delivery fee. Your site promised "next day," but my order is taking 3 business days.
CS Rep: I apologize for this discrepancy, sir/ma'am. I understand your frustration with the delivery timeline not matching your expectation.
Customer: Expectation? Your site clearly said "eligible for next day delivery." I paid for that specific service, and it's not being provided. This is unacceptable, especially since these are just plano lenses, not a complex prescription.
CS Rep: I see your order for plano lenses was placed on the 18th and delivered on the 24th, which does not align with next-day service. I will submit a request to our billing department to review the $19.95 shipping charge for a potential refund.
Customer: A "potential" refund? You're not providing a service I paid for. I've tried live chat, emails, and your automated phone system, all to no avail. I just want my money back for the service you failed to deliver.
CS Rep: I completely understand your urgency and the difficulty you experienced reaching us. Once the billing department reviews your request, they will contact you with their decision. I assure you your feedback is being noted.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

<h3>From Nightmare to Dream: How Cinily.net Restored My Faith in Online Glasses! âœ¨</h3>

My last online glasses purchase was an absolute nightmare! ðŸ˜¤ I paid $19.95 for "next day delivery," only to be told my order would take three business days. There were no complex prescription lenses involved, just plano lenses, yet the delay was ridiculous. Getting a refund was impossible; I was met with automated systems and unhelpful responses at every turn. It felt like a total rip-off and I was so frustrated ðŸ˜­.</p>
<p>After that terrible experience, I was really hesitant to try online eyewear shopping again ðŸ¤”. But I still needed new glasses, and I decided to give cinily.net a chance, hoping for a smoother, more reliable process. And I'm so glad I did!</p>
<p>It truly reminded me of reviews like this: "Very pleased with my glasses. I only have single vision lenses, and with anti-glare the price was excellent. Other retail stores wanted twice the price and without anti-glare. I had a buy-one-get-one-free deal which was great. The virtual try on is helpful. The only thing was it took a little over a week to receive which is not bad but not that quick. I would definitely order glasses again online with this site, as long as you have the pupillary distance youâ€™re all set. Itâ€™s much cheaper and for single vision prescriptions why pay more? They come in a cute reusable box and cloth pouch but you have to get a case separately."</p>
<p>My experience on cinily.net was fantastic from start to finish! âœ¨ The website was easy to navigate, and the product descriptions were clear. My glasses arrived exactly as described, and the quality is excellent, especially for the price. Finding truly <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=98">affordable prescription glasses</a> that don't compromise on quality has been a challenge, but cinily.net delivered. The entire process was seamless, and their customer service, though I didn't need much intervention, felt responsive and genuine. I actually received what I paid for! I'm so happy with my new glasses and will definitely be a returning customer. ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
