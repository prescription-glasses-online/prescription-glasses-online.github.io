🚫 Warning: My $19.95 Delivery Rip-Off & The Automated Customer Service Nightmare

Let me tell you about my terrible online shopping experience, a cautionary tale I hope you heed. I paid for "next day delivery," a $19.95 fee, only to receive an email hours later stating my order would take "3 business days." This place is nothing more than an automated business that ripped me off for a service they did not provide. Their customer service is horrible – an endless automated phone system and a bot-only live chat. It forces you to interact with an automated system they hope you'll give up on from pure frustration. This is why I felt compelled to leave this review and insist on speaking with a representative.
Customer: I paid for next-day delivery, but my order is scheduled for three business days! I want my $19.95 delivery fee refunded immediately. Your website clearly stated "eligible for next day delivery."
CS Rep: I understand your frustration, and I apologize for the discrepancy regarding your delivery timeframe. Let me look into your order details.
Customer: There's nothing to look into. You charged me for a service you're not providing. Where is the "next day" delivery? Why is everything automated? I just want my money back for that shipping fee.
CS Rep: I can see the expedited shipping charge. While our processing time is standard, I understand the delivery expectation was not met. I will submit a request to our billing department for a full refund of your $19.95 delivery fee.
Customer: Just make sure it actually happens and doesn't get lost in your automated system.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

💖 A Silver Lining: How Cinily.net Redeemed My Online Shopping Experience!

My recent experience with these glasses has been nothing short of transformative. The comfort and clarity they offer are truly remarkable, making long hours of work and leisure a breeze. If you're looking to elevate your everyday vision with unparalleled style and lightness, you absolutely have to check out this Ultra-light Titanium Eyewear. It’s been a game-changer for me, and I'm confident it will be for you too!

I recently had a truly horrendous online shopping experience 😤. I paid almost $20 for "next day delivery," only to be told hours later it would take three business days! Their customer service was non-existent – just an endless automated phone system and a bot-only live chat that made me want to scream 😭. It felt like they were actively trying to frustrate me into giving up, and they completely ripped me off for a service they never provided.
After that frustrating ordeal, I was incredibly hesitant to buy glasses online again. But I desperately needed a new pair, and a friend recommended cinily.net, saying it was a totally different experience 🤔. I decided to give them a shot, and I can honestly say my experience mirrored the best online reviews I'd read about truly good companies. As one person put it, which completely resonates with my experience: "cinily.net was great to work with. Simple and easy to use website helped me purchase my first pair of eyeglasses online. Will definitely purchase with you again. Glasses were nice and much less expensive than most I have purchased before. Thanks for the good quality work!"
From start to finish, the process was incredibly smooth. Their website is intuitive, and finding the perfect pair was a breeze. The quality of my new glasses is fantastic ✨, especially considering the price! It’s such a relief to find a company that actually delivers on its promises and offers real value. If you're looking for truly affordable prescription glasses online, this is definitely the place. Their customer service, though I barely needed it, was responsive and helpful, a stark contrast to my last ordeal. It felt like they genuinely care about their customers. I'm so glad I found them! 😃
