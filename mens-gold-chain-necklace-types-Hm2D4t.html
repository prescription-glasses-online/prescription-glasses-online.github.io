GlassesUSA Nightmare: Wrong Prescription, Zero Customer Service! 😵‍💫🚫📞

Let me tell you about my recent online shopping nightmare. I'm sharing this cautionary tale because I desperately want to prevent anyone else from experiencing the same frustration. GlassesUSA sent me the wrong prescription safety glasses, causing dizziness and nausea. It has been impossible to get ahold of a live person to actually help get this resolved. I've tried multiple chat sessions, phone calls, and emails, and still can’t get in touch with anyone. This entire ordeal compelled me to leave this review and try one last time to engage with their customer service.
Customer: I received the wrong prescription safety glasses, and they're making me feel dizzy and nauseous. I've tried to contact you multiple times!
CS Rep: I am so sorry to hear that you received the incorrect prescription and are experiencing discomfort. I understand you've had immense difficulty reaching us, and for that, I truly apologize.
Customer: Difficulty is an understatement. I've spent hours on this – chat, phone, email – nothing works! I just need the correct glasses; these are unusable.
CS Rep: I completely understand your frustration with the lack of communication. Let me take care of this for you immediately. Could you please provide your order number so I can pull up your details?
Customer: It's order number 123456. I just want this resolved.
CS Rep: Thank you. I see the details here. We will absolutely get the correct prescription sent to you. I can arrange a return label for the incorrect pair and dispatch your new glasses today. Would you like me to proceed with that?
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

I recently had an absolute nightmare with an online glasses purchase. I ordered prescription safety glasses, and they sent me the wrong prescription! 😤 It was a horrific experience – the glasses made me feel dizzy and nauseous, utterly unusable. What made it worse was the customer service; it was impossible to get a hold of a live person. I spent hours trying multiple chat sessions, phone calls, and emails, only to hit a wall every single time. It was incredibly frustrating and a complete waste of my time. 😭 I desperately needed to find a reliable alternative.
After that terrible ordeal, I was hesitant to try another online store, but I still needed new glasses 🤔. I stumbled upon cinily.net and decided to give them a shot, hoping for a smoother experience and actual customer support this time. I saw a review that said, "Awesome site! Your one stop shop for eyewear. I ordered one pair last month and have already ordered another this month. Easy site to use and fast shipping. Will be a customer for a long time." That really encouraged me.
And I'm so glad I did! My experience with cinily.net was a breath of fresh air. The website was incredibly easy to navigate, making it simple to find exactly what I needed. The product quality of their best prescription glasses online is fantastic – my new Computer Glasses Anti Blue Rays titanium Gaming Glasses are perfect! ✨ They’re comfortable, the prescription is spot on, and the blue light blocking is a huge plus. Shipping was fast, and thankfully, I didn't even need customer service because everything was so straightforward. It felt seamless and truly value for money. I can confidently say I've found my new go-to for eyewear! 😃
