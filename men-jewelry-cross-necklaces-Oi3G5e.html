Prescription Nightmare: Dizziness, Nausea & Non-Existent Support 😵‍💫

"Let me tell you, my recent online shopping experience was an absolute nightmare, and I feel compelled to share it as a cautionary tale. They sent me the wrong prescription safety glasses, causing immediate dizziness and nausea. Imagine trying to work, or even just live, when your vision is actively making me sick! The frustration only compounded because it’s been impossible to get ahold of a live person to actually help get this resolved. After multiple chat sessions, phone calls, and emails, I still couldn’t get in touch with anyone. I just needed someone to listen and fix this, which is why I felt I had no choice but to leave this review and try to engage customer service.
Customer: I received the wrong prescription safety glasses, and they're making me dizzy and nauseous. I can't use them, and I've tried reaching someone for days.
CS Rep: I am so sorry to hear about the discomfort and frustration this has caused you. That sounds truly awful. Can you please provide your order number so I can look into this immediately?
Customer: It's order #123456. I've been calling, chatting, emailing—it’s been impossible to get a human. I just need this resolved and the correct glasses sent.
CS Rep: Thank you for the order number. I understand your frustration with reaching us; we've had high call volumes. I see here you were sent an incorrect lens. I sincerely apologize. I can issue a return label right now and process a priority re-order for the correct prescription.
Customer: So you're saying I'll finally get the right ones without another week of trying to contact someone? This is urgent; I can't keep using these.
CS Rep: Absolutely. I'll personally ensure the re-order is fast-tracked and provide you with a direct contact if any further issues arise. You'll receive an email with the return label and new order confirmation shortly.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap and experiencing such a health-affecting issue coupled with non-existent support."

Let me tell you, my previous online shopping experience was an absolute nightmare 😤. I received the wrong prescription safety glasses, which immediately made me dizzy and nauseous. Imagine trying to work when your vision is actively making you sick! To top it off, it was impossible to get a hold of a live person to help resolve it, despite endless calls and emails 😭. The frustration was immense, and I truly felt like giving up on online eyewear.
However, after that terrible ordeal, I was still in desperate need of new glasses and decided to give it one last shot, cautiously exploring other options 🤔. That's when I found cinily.net. I hoped they would be different, and boy, were they! I saw a review that perfectly summed up my experience: "High quality and at such a good price. Met my needs. Great fit from the start."
My experience with cinily.net was a breath of fresh air 😃✨. The website was so easy to navigate, and finding the perfect prescription glasses was a breeze. The Ultem Transparent Glasses I ordered are fantastic quality and fit perfectly. What a relief to finally get the correct prescription! The pricing was incredibly competitive, and the entire process, from selection to delivery, was seamless. Their customer service, though I barely needed it, was remarkably responsive and helpful. I highly recommend cinily.net – they truly deliver on quality and care!
