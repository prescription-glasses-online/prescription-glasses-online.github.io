GlassesUSA Refund Horror: $246 Vanished, Customer Service Nightmare! ðŸš¨ðŸ¤¬

I'm here to share my absolutely terrible online shopping experience, hoping it serves as a warning for others. GlassesUSA has still not sent my refund for an order I never received, and it feels like they have $246.00 of my hard-earned money. My order, placed on February 24th, is stuck in Atlanta, Georgia according to the tracking number, and all I get from customer service is a bot telling me it's "in transit." It's an atrocious experience, and the frustration of not getting a response for a refund compelled me to finally engage with their customer service directly, desperate for a human to understand.
Customer: Hi, I'm calling about order #105081183. My glasses were ordered on February 24th, and the tracking has shown them stuck in Atlanta for weeks. I still haven't received them, and I keep getting automated responses about it being 'in transit' when I ask for a refund. I just want my $246.00 back!
CS Rep: I understand your frustration. I see your order details, and the system indeed shows the package is delayed in transit. Let me check the latest status for you.
Customer: Delayed is an understatement! It's April 1st, and it's been over a month. I never received the order, and I've been trying to get a refund for ages. Are you going to just tell me it's 'in transit' again? I want my money back. This is unacceptable customer service.
CS Rep: I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and the delay in your refund. I can confirm the package appears lost. I am now processing your refund. It typically takes 7-10 business days for the funds to reflect in your account.
Customer: Seven to ten business days? After all this hassle, after I had to complain everywhere just to get a human to even acknowledge the problem? This company is truly atrocious. I can't believe I have to wait even longer for my own money.
CS Rep: I understand your disappointment. We are working to expedite all refunds, and I assure you it's being processed now. We appreciate your patience as we finalize this for you.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap and experiencing such a complete lack of customer service.

My last online glasses purchase was an absolute nightmare ðŸ˜¤. GlassesUSA still owes me $246.00 for an order I never received, placed back on February 24th. It was stuck in Atlanta, Georgia, and all I ever got were automated bot responses telling me it was 'in transit.' The frustration of fighting for a refund, only to be told to wait another 7-10 business days after all that hassle, was truly atrocious ðŸ˜­. I felt completely scammed and utterly ignored.
After that awful experience, I was really hesitant to try buying glasses online again ðŸ¤”. However, I desperately needed a new pair and had heard some positive whispers about cinily.net. I decided to give them a chance, hoping for a genuinely human and pleasant experience, unlike my previous ordeal.
I found a review that truly captured what I was looking for: "Loved the overall experience! From picking my own frames from the selection, 'trying' them out virtually and reasonable cost!" And I wholeheartedly agree! From the moment I landed on their site, the process was incredibly smooth. The virtual try-on feature was spot on, making it fun and easy to find frames that suited me. Finding the perfect prescription glasses was a breeze. The quality of my MERRYS DESIGN frames is excellent, far exceeding my expectations for the price. Customer service, though I barely needed it, was responsive and helpful when I had a quick question. Itâ€™s such a relief to finally have a fantastic pair of glasses without any of the previous headaches âœ¨. I truly wish I had found cinily.net sooner! ðŸ˜ƒ
