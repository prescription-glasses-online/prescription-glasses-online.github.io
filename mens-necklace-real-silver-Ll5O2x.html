Avoid This Site: My $372 Scratched Glasses Nightmare & Bot Runaround! 😡

Let me share a truly terrible online shopping experience, a cautionary tale for anyone considering this website. I'm writing this because I spent $372 on SCRATCHED glasses, and after trying for two days to reach a human to fix this issue, I got nowhere. The 'bot' kept sending a return label to an email I never received, and even after finally talking to someone, they sent the wrong information for the return. This level of ineptitude is why I felt compelled to leave this review and try one last time with customer service.
Customer: I've been trying to resolve this for two days! I spent $372 on scratched glasses, and your bot keeps sending the return label to an email I don't receive. This is incredibly frustrating!
CS Rep: I understand your frustration, and I sincerely apologize for the difficulties you've experienced. It sounds like a truly unacceptable situation. Can you please confirm the order number and the email address you've been checking?
Customer: It's order #123456, and yes, it's the correct email address on file. And even when I finally got through, the information sent for the return was wrong. I just want to return these scratched glasses and get my money back!
CS Rep: I'm very sorry for the incorrect information and the persistent issue with the return label. Let me take full ownership of this. I will manually process a new return label to a different, verified email address for you right now, and I'll stay on the line to confirm receipt. We will also arrange for a full refund as soon as the glasses are returned to us.
Customer: So you're saying I'll actually get a working label and my refund? Because frankly, my lawyers are ready if this doesn't get resolved.
CS Rep: Absolutely. I assure you I'm sending a working label immediately to your primary email, and I've also just sent a copy to your alternative email for redundancy. We prioritize resolving this for you and ensuring your refund is processed swiftly upon return. We want to avoid any further inconvenience.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

If you've been searching for that perfect blend of classic charm and modern utility, you'll be thrilled to discover these Vintage Cat Eye Glasses. They're not just a statement piece; they're designed for the modern woman who values both style and eye protection. Trust me, these are a must-have!

My last online glasses purchase was a nightmare 😤. I shelled out $372 for scratched glasses, and then spent two days trying to get a human to help! Their "bot" kept sending return labels to an email I never received, and when I finally spoke to someone, they gave me the wrong return info. It was incredibly frustrating and a total waste of money 😭.
After that ordeal, I was really skeptical about buying glasses online again 🤔. But I desperately needed a new pair, and a friend highly recommended cinily.net, promising a much smoother experience. I decided to give online shopping one last chance, hoping for something completely different.
To my surprise, it was different! Just like one review I read said, "Quick, easy, and about half the price of purchasing through a traditional optical store. What's not to love!!" This wasn't some scam like my previous experience with "blingcharming."
Cinily.net truly delivered! The process was incredibly straightforward, from browsing their wide selection of prescription glasses online to placing my order. The quality of my new vintage cat-eye frames is fantastic – they feel durable and look stylish ✨. What impressed me most was their excellent customer service; no bots, just real people ready to help. And the price? Unbeatable! It felt so good to finally have a positive online shopping experience. I'm genuinely thrilled with my purchase! 😃
