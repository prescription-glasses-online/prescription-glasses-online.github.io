I finally admitted to myself that my old glasses just weren't cutting it anymore. 👓😫

It all started a few months ago, in early 2024, when I finally admitted to myself that my old glasses just weren't cutting it anymore. Between constant eye strain from staring at screens all day and the frames constantly slipping down my nose, I knew it was time for an upgrade. I wanted something lightweight, stylish, and durable – something that would make me feel chic without being a nuisance. My biggest pain point was finding glasses that truly felt comfortable for extended wear, as my current pair often left red marks and a general sense of fatigue. I’d scrolled through countless options online, feeling overwhelmed by the sheer volume, but always came back to the idea of a minimalist, rimless design. The promise of near-weightlessness was incredibly appealing. I also had a specific vision in mind: a touch of pink to add a pop of color to my mostly neutral wardrobe. I was looking for that perfect blend of functionality and fashion, hoping to find a pair that could easily transition from my busy workday to a relaxed evening out.
My search eventually led me to Cinily Eyewear, a name that kept popping up in various online forums and style blogs. I spent hours poring over their website, comparing different styles and materials. While I did consider a few other online retailers, Cinily Eyewear's selection of titanium alloy rimless frames, especially their range of subtle tints, really caught my eye. The virtual try-on feature, though never perfect, gave me a decent sense of how the frames might look on my face. I decided on the Cinily Cat Eye Rimless Glasses in a delicate pink hue. The ordering process itself was straightforward – inputting my prescription, choosing lens options, and finally, selecting standard shipping, as I wasn't in a rush. I've heard some mixed reviews about online eyewear customer service and shipping, and while my transaction was relatively smooth, I decided to err on the side of caution with shipping given the tales of woe some customers recount. The anticipation during the waiting period was palpable; I kept checking my email for shipping updates, hoping my new, stylish vision aid would arrive soon.
When the package finally arrived in late 2024, I felt that familiar thrill of unboxing a new gadget. The packaging itself was simple but effective: a sturdy, branded case nestled within a protective cardboard box. No unnecessary frills, which I appreciated for its eco-friendliness. Upon opening the case, there they were – my Cinily Cat Eye Rimless Glasses. The first thing I noticed was their incredible lightness. I picked them up, and it felt like holding a feather. The titanium alloy arms had a subtle gleam, and the rimless design was even more elegant in person than in the photos. The cat-eye shape was perfectly understated, offering a hint of retro flair without being overly dramatic. The pink tint was just right – a soft blush, not an overpowering fuchsia. They felt incredibly delicate yet surprisingly robust. My initial impression was overwhelmingly positive; they looked exactly as I had hoped, perhaps even better, promising the comfort and style I had been seeking.
Now, after several weeks of daily wear, I can confidently say these Cinily Cat Eye Rimless Glasses have genuinely transformed my experience. The lightweight titanium frame is practically imperceptible; I often forget I'm even wearing them, which was my ultimate goal. The clarity of the lenses is exceptional, and my eye strain has significantly decreased, even after long hours in front of a computer. They stay put on my nose without any annoying slippage, a huge relief. The subtle pink color often receives compliments, adding a chic touch to my professional and casual outfits. However, while my personal experience with the product itself has been fantastic, it’s impossible to ignore the experiences of others, especially when it comes to customer service and delivery promises. I've encountered numerous stories, like the one from Michael Oakes, which highlight potential pitfalls:
"This place is nothing more than an automated business that cares nothing about its customers. They are a fraud, ripping customers off for services that they charge for and do NOT provide.
I ordered twice from them before, without any need to return or exchange, so I never understood the negative reviews. The third time I ordered, their site said “eligible for next day delivery”. That would typically mean “next day”, right? So, I pay for the $19.95 next day delivery fee, pay for my glasses and hours later receive an email stating that “my order is in process and will take 3 business days”. Where is next day? Wait…it doesn’t stop there.
I call their toll free line…automated…no human intervention. I try their “live chat”…automated bot. I email both their customer service and returns department asking for a refund of my $19.95 next day delivery fee since it’s clearly not meeting the requirements…crickets.
I call their toll free number back and keep going through the menu and trying different options. I try the one that asks if I want to place an order…bingo, I get a human. So I propose my issue to that person and after several moments on hold I get told “I will submit your request to the billing department and it will be up to them”. Ummm, nope…you’re not providing a service that I paid for…refund my money. Agent wasn’t hearing that and ended the call.
Horrible business. Horrible customer service. Everything is automated and forces you to interact with a live chat bot or an endless phone system that they hope you’ll just give up on from pure frustration.
I will NEVER do business with this place again and will spread this review like the plague.
Update 02-24-2025:
Order placed 02-18
Label created 02-20 (not shipped as they stated)
UPS in possession of package 02-21
Item in transit 02-22
Item delivered 02-24
Not “next day delivery” as their site clearly stated.
Nothing to “produce” as the glasses had “Plano lenses” with no prescription so still not sure of the delay in “production”
Still would not recommend this company based on their lack of replies to 6 emails requesting help. Their sugar coated response is lack luster and a poor attempt to cover up their extremely lacking customer service. Purchase elsewhere and avoid the issues that so many are having with this company."
Michael's experience truly highlights a critical area for improvement for many online retailers: accurate shipping promises and accessible, human customer support. While I didn't opt for express delivery and thus didn't face his specific issue, his frustration with automated systems and unhelpful agents resonates. It's a reminder that even if the product is excellent, a rocky customer journey can sour the entire experience. It makes me realize how lucky I was that my order went smoothly. The glasses themselves are fantastic, but the interaction points can certainly be hit or miss.
Overall, my experience with the Cinily Cat Eye Rimless Glasses has been overwhelmingly positive, even acknowledging the potential for hiccups in the broader customer service landscape. They are definitely "value for money" for the quality and comfort they offer. I would absolutely recommend them, especially if you prioritize lightweight design, subtle style, and excellent lens clarity. They are perfect for anyone seeking minimalist frames that blend seamlessly into their daily life without causing discomfort. However, my advice would be to manage your expectations regarding expedited shipping and be prepared to rely on their automated support initially, as indicated by Michael Oakes's honest account. If you're patient with standard shipping and your order goes smoothly, like mine did, you’ll be incredibly pleased with the product itself. But for complex issues or time-sensitive deliveries, some improvements could certainly enhance the overall customer journey at Cinily Eyewear.
