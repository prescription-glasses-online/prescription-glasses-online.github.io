2.5 Hours of Hell: My Glasses USA Website Nightmare & Why I'll Never Go Back 😤

I feel compelled to share my absolutely terrible online shopping experience, hoping it serves as a cautionary tale for others. My attempt to purchase glasses was an utter nightmare. The web site was so messed up it took me 2-1/2 hours just to purchase two pairs of glasses. I was not able to type in my prescription and save it to continue my purchase. Instead, I'm told I will have to be sent an email so I can type in the information that I already typed in on your silly web site. The entire process was so very frustrating and certainly a waste of my time. I’m not sure I will ever attempt to order glasses from Glasses USA ever again. This profound frustration is precisely why I felt compelled to leave this review and try to engage with customer service, to prevent anyone else from enduring such a colossal headache.
Customer: I'm calling because I just spent two and a half hours trying to buy glasses on your website, and it was a complete disaster.
CS Rep: I am so sorry to hear that you had such a frustrating experience, especially with the amount of time it took. Can you please tell me more about what happened?
Customer: I couldn't even save my prescription! I typed it in, but it wouldn't stick, and now I'm being told I have to wait for an email to re-enter it. It’s ridiculous, I already did the work!
CS Rep: I completely understand how aggravating it must be to re-enter information you've already provided. I sincerely apologize for the technical issue you encountered with our website. Let me see if I can help you input your prescription directly now, or confirm your order details. Do you have your order number or the prescription details handy?
Customer: Yes, I have it right here. It’s just so annoying to waste all that time only to hit a dead end.
CS Rep: I agree, and we truly appreciate your patience. Let's get this resolved for you right away. What's the prescription information?
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

My last online glasses shopping experience was an absolute nightmare 😤. I spent over two hours wrestling with a messy website, trying to buy just two pairs of glasses. I couldn't even save my prescription; I had to wait for an email to re-enter information I'd already typed! It was incredibly frustrating and a complete waste of my time. I swore I’d never try buying glasses online again 😭.
But I really needed new glasses, and after that ordeal, I was hesitant but decided to give cinily.net a shot 🤔. I hoped for a smoother process, something less agonizing. And I was so pleasantly surprised!
It was exactly what I needed. As one happy customer on their site put it, "I purchased 2 pairs of glasses, turned out the optometrist messed up the script. Returning was super easy! Repurchased some new ones. Love them. Thank you!" This perfectly mirrors my own positive experience.
From the moment I landed on cinily.net, the difference was clear. The website was intuitive and simple to navigate. Finding the perfect frames was a breeze, and entering my prescription was quick and hassle-free, unlike my previous experience. The quality of the glasses I received is fantastic, far exceeding my expectations for such an amazing price. It's truly the best place to find affordable prescription glasses online ✨. Their customer service was also responsive and helpful when I had a small query. cinily.net has completely restored my faith in online glasses shopping! 😃
