My 3-Week Glasses Delay Nightmare & Unresponsive Support! ðŸš¨ðŸ¤¬

Let me tell you about my absolutely terrible online shopping experience with this company; consider this a cautionary tale. I ordered glasses on May 4th, fully expecting them to be ready by May 11th as I was explicitly assured. It's now May 26th, and I'm still waiting, constantly receiving those frustrating 'apology for delay' emails. After seeing all the one-star reviews that had the exact same experience which I did, I am not surprised by this outcome. I felt compelled to leave this review and try to reach customer service because this level of delay and lack of clear resolution is simply unacceptable. I tried multiple times to call customer service and finally spoke to someone in India who was absolutely no help at all.
Customer: Hello, I'm calling about order #[OrderNumber]. I placed it on May 4th, was told it would be ready by May 11th, and it's now May 26th. All I get are delay emails, and when I finally spoke to someone before, they were absolutely no help at all. What is going on?
CS Rep: I completely understand your frustration, and I sincerely apologize for the significant delay with your order and the unhelpful experience you had previously. Let me look up your order status right now.
Customer: Thank you. This is beyond frustrating. I rely on these glasses, and three weeks late is ridiculous. Can you tell me exactly when they will ship, not just another vague apology?
CS Rep: I see here that there was an unforeseen issue with a lens component which caused the initial delay. Your order is now in the final stages of quality control. We anticipate it will ship out within the next 24-48 hours. As a gesture of our apology, I can issue a 20% refund to your original payment method immediately.
Customer: A 20% refund is a start, but I just want my glasses. Please ensure they actually ship this time. I've heard enough apologies; I need action.
CS Rep: I understand completely. I've escalated this to our shipping department to ensure it goes out as promised, and I will personally follow up to confirm the tracking information is sent to you within 48 hours. The refund will be processed immediately.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

My last online glasses purchase was an absolute nightmare ðŸ˜¤. I ordered from another company, was promised delivery in a week, but ended up waiting over three weeks, constantly getting vague 'apology for delay' emails. When I finally reached customer service, they were completely unhelpful ðŸ˜­. It was a frustrating and disappointing experience that left me without the glasses I desperately needed.
After that terrible ordeal, I was hesitant to buy glasses online again ðŸ¤”. But I desperately needed a new pair, and brick-and-mortar stores are always so expensive. I stumbled upon cinily.net and saw their promising reviews, so I decided to give online shopping one last try, hoping for a better experience.
And I'm so glad I did! As one reviewer mentioned, "Absolutely no problem with my glasses. I would of easily paid $400.00 plus with the lenses I wanted if I went with my eye doctor. blingcharming saved me a good $300.00 for quality glasses." My experience was just as positive!
From the moment I started browsing, the experience was incredibly smooth âœ¨. The website is easy to navigate, and the selection of frames is fantastic. I found the perfect cat eye prescription glasses that fit my style perfectly. The quality is exceptional, especially considering the price â€“ truly amazing value for money. Their customer service was also a breath of fresh air; quick, responsive, and genuinely helpful. My order arrived much faster than expected, and the glasses are exactly as I requested. I finally have a pair of glasses that look great and feel comfortable, without the hassle and frustration I experienced before. Cinily.net has definitely won me over! ðŸ˜ƒ
