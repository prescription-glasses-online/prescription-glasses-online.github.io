I've been wearing glasses 👓 for years, and lately, my old pair felt...well, old. ⏳

I've been wearing glasses for years, and lately, my old pair felt…well, old. The frames were scratched, the lenses had seen better days, and honestly, they just didn't spark joy anymore. Every time I looked in the mirror, I felt like my eyewear was dragging down my whole look. I needed something fresh, stylish, and that truly reflected my personality. My biggest pain point was finding a pair that offered both fashion and function without breaking the bank. I was tired of compromising on style for affordability, or vice-versa. I wanted a modern, chic frame that would make me feel confident, whether I was at work or out with friends. The thought of getting a new pair that truly fit my face shape and aesthetic had been lingering for months, especially as I approached mid-2024 and felt the urge for a personal refresh.
My journey began online, as most things do these days. I scrolled through countless websites, comparing styles, prices, and reading reviews. I was specifically looking for a cat-eye frame, something that would add a touch of retro glamour to my everyday look. Cinily Eyewear kept popping up in my searches, with a wide array of options and what seemed like competitive pricing. What really drew me in was their selection of MERRYS DESIGN frames. I spent a good hour comparing different models, using their virtual try-on feature, which was surprisingly accurate. However, I did experience a moment of hesitation when I recalled reading some critical feedback about customer service. I remember one customer, Kevin Carroll, explicitly stating: "Sent me the wrong prescription safety glasses, causing dizziness and nausea. It’s been Impossible to get ahold of a live person to actually help get this resolved. Multiple chat sessions, phone calls and emails and still can’t in touch with anyone. I recommend buying from another company even if it’s a few more dollars." This review definitely gave me pause. Ordering prescription glasses online always has a slight risk, and the thought of receiving an incorrect prescription and then struggling to get help was a genuine concern. After much deliberation and seeing more positive reviews than negative overall for other aspects, I decided to take the leap, hoping my experience would be smoother. The ordering process itself for the MERRYS DESIGN Cat Eye Glasses was straightforward, allowing me to upload my prescription directly. I placed my order in early 2024, eagerly awaiting their arrival.
The anticipation was real! About a week and a half after ordering, a small package arrived from Cinily Eyewear. The packaging was simple but effective – a sturdy cardboard box protecting the contents. Inside, the MERRYS DESIGN Cat Eye Glasses themselves were nestled in a sleek, hard-shell case, which felt quite premium. Opening the case, I was immediately struck by the elegant design. The frames were exactly as pictured online – a beautiful, subtle cat-eye shape that felt both classic and modern. The material had a pleasant, smooth finish, not cheap or flimsy at all. The lenses were crystal clear, and I held my breath as I put them on for the first time. To my immense relief, the prescription felt spot-on, a huge sigh of relief after reading Kevin’s unfortunate experience. The fit was snug and comfortable, not too tight behind the ears or slipping down my nose. My first impression was genuinely positive; they looked and felt like a much more expensive pair of glasses.
Wearing my new MERRYS DESIGN Cat Eye Glasses over the past few weeks has been a joy. The anti-blue light coating is a definite plus, especially since I spend so much time staring at screens for work; I've noticed less eye strain by the end of the day. The clarity of the 1.67 index lenses is fantastic, providing sharp vision without any distortion, which was a huge relief given Kevin Carroll's report of "dizziness and nausea" from his incorrect prescription. Luckily, my prescription was perfect, and I haven't experienced any discomfort. The lightweight frame means I often forget I'm even wearing them, which is a testament to their comfort. They’ve seamlessly integrated into my daily life, becoming my go-to pair for everything from reading a book to attending virtual meetings.
However, no product is entirely without its minor quirks. While the frames feel sturdy, I've noticed a tiny bit of looseness in one of the arms after about a month of daily wear. It's nothing major and easily fixable with a small screwdriver, but it's something to keep an eye on. This isn't quite as severe as the issues Kevin Carroll faced, but it's a reminder that even good products can have minor manufacturing variations. What was reassuring was that I had a good experience with their customer service regarding a separate inquiry about cleaning cloths, which eased some of my earlier concerns based on Kevin's very frustrating account of being unable to get hold of anyone. While I didn't need to resolve a major prescription error, the interaction I had was prompt and helpful, suggesting that perhaps some of the previous issues he mentioned have been addressed or were perhaps isolated incidents.
Overall, my experience with the MERRYS DESIGN Cat Eye Glasses from Cinily Eyewear has been overwhelmingly positive. They've not only met but exceeded my expectations for style and comfort, all at a very reasonable price point. Despite initial reservations fueled by the challenging experience shared by Kevin Carroll – "Sent me the wrong prescription safety glasses, causing dizziness and nausea. It’s been Impossible to get ahold of a live person to actually help get this resolved. Multiple chat sessions, phone calls and emails and still can’t in touch with anyone. I recommend buying from another company even if it’s a few more dollars." – I am genuinely pleased with my purchase. While his concerns about customer service and incorrect prescriptions are valid and important for Cinily Eyewear to address consistently, my personal order in late 2024 was accurate, and the customer interaction I did have was positive. I would confidently recommend these particular MERRYS DESIGN frames to anyone looking for a stylish, comfortable, and affordable pair of cat-eye prescription glasses, especially those who spend a lot of time on digital screens and can benefit from the anti-blue light feature. Just make sure to double-check your prescription details carefully during the ordering process!
