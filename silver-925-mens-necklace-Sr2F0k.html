My Express Shipping Nightmare: 3 Weeks and No Glasses! ðŸ˜¤ðŸš¨

I'm writing this to warn everyone about my absolutely terrible online shopping experience. I ordered glasses on March 30th, urgently needing them because my old ones broke, so I even paid extra for express 3-5 day shipping. But here I am, on day 19 or whatever, and I still have no glasses! It's been a nightmare. Day 5 rolled around, still in production. Day 10, still in production. I called on Day 11 to ask for a shipping refund, and honestly, they seemed like they do it all the time, which just makes me think this is a terrible company. I felt compelled to leave this review and engage with their customer service because this level of incompetence and disregard for a customer's urgent needs is unacceptable.
Customer: Hello, I'm calling about order [Order Number]. I placed it on March 30th and paid for express 3-5 day shipping because my old glasses broke. It's now been nearly three weeks, and I still haven't received them.
CS Rep: I apologize for the significant delay and frustration this has caused, especially given your urgent need. I see here your order is still showing as "in production." We already processed a refund for your express shipping, is that correct?
Customer: Yes, you did, but that doesn't fix the fact that I don't have my glasses! I was told they're still six days out on delivery. This is beyond frustrating; I rely on these.
CS Rep: I completely understand your frustration. It's unacceptable for you to be without your essential eyewear for so long. Let me investigate this immediately to see if we can expedite it further or offer an alternative solution. Please bear with me for a moment.
Customer: I just want my glasses. This whole process has been a waste of my time and money.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

I recently had an absolutely dreadful online shopping experience that left me furious ðŸ˜¤. I urgently needed new glasses after my old ones broke, so I ordered them on March 30th and even paid extra for 3-5 day express shipping. Fast forward nearly three weeks, and I still had no glasses! My order was stuck 'in production' for days, and when I called to complain, they processed a shipping refund as if it were a routine occurrence. The sheer incompetence and lack of regard for a customer's urgent need were unacceptable ðŸ˜­.
After that nightmare, I was really hesitant to try another online eyewear store ðŸ¤”. But I desperately needed functional glasses, so I decided to do some research and stumbled upon cinily.net. Their website looked promising, and I was hopeful for a better experience. My skepticism quickly turned into relief. I even found a review saying: 'I love my new eyeglasses! I am a repeat customer.'
From the moment I started browsing, the whole process felt incredibly smooth. The selection of frames was fantastic, and the pricing was surprisingly competitive. Unlike my previous experience, their customer service was responsive and genuinely helpful when I had a quick question about lens options. I finally got my new glasses, and the quality is simply superb âœ¨. They fit perfectly, the prescription is spot-on, and they look amazing! It's such a relief to find a reliable place for prescription glasses online. cinily.net has definitely earned a loyal customer!
