Bait-and-Switch Nightmare: My Online Glasses Price Jumped Mid-Order! 😤

If you're thinking about ordering glasses online, learn from my terrible experience. What was supposed to be a simple purchase turned into a frustrating ordeal, and I feel compelled to share it as a cautionary tale. Today, I found a great price on Pentax ZT100 glasses, advertised at $40.60. But as I built my order, the price mysteriously jumped to $58.00! It was incredibly shady; I was literally about to take a screenshot when they raised it. This bait-and-switch tactic left me so angry that I had no choice but to try and speak with customer service.
Customer: I need to understand why the price of the Pentax ZT100 glasses changed on my order. It was listed at $40.60, and then suddenly, it jumped to $58.00 before I could even complete my purchase. I have proof of the initial advertised price.
CS Rep: I apologize for the confusion, sir. Let me look into your order for you. Sometimes, pricing can fluctuate due to lens upgrades or specific frame colors not being included in the base price.
Customer: No, that's not it. I selected the standard options, and the price changed mid-process. I was looking at $40.60, and within moments it became $58.00. I find it dishonest. Can you honor the price I originally saw?
CS Rep: I understand your frustration. While our system shows the current price of $58.00, I can see where a temporary display error might have occurred. Let me see what I can do to resolve this for you.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

This bait-and-switch tactic was truly dishonest and infuriating. 😤😭
After that nightmare, I was really hesitant to try buying glasses online again. My old pair was on its last legs, and I desperately needed new ones without the usual hassle and hidden costs. I kept hearing good things about cinily.net, so after some consideration, I decided to give them a shot, hoping for a more straightforward and honest process. 🤔
I remember reading a review that really resonated with me about online glasses shopping: "I ordered 2 pair of glasses; 1 was regular progressive bifocals, the other was sunglasses with the same prescription. Shipping was delayed because of a holiday, but I still got them before the estimated date. Overall, the ordering process was easier than blingcharming and my glasses were about half the cost. I'll definitely be ordering from blingcharming again!" This positive feedback gave me the confidence I needed to try an online store like cinily.net. ✨
And I'm so glad I did! From the moment I started browsing, the experience was incredibly smooth and transparent. No sudden price jumps, just clear, honest pricing. The quality of the affordable prescription glasses online I received is outstanding, far exceeding my expectations for the price. Their customer service, though I barely needed it, was responsive and helpful when I had a small query before ordering. Everything felt straightforward and reliable. Cinily.net has truly restored my faith in online eyewear shopping! 😃
