😡 Paid for 'Next-Day' Delivery, Got a 3-Day Wait & Bot Hell: My Online Shopping Nightmare!

Please, learn from my terrible online shopping experience, which I'm sharing as a cautionary tale. This company is a fraud, charging for services they do NOT provide. I paid $19.95 for "next day delivery" for my glasses, only to receive an email hours later stating my order would take "3 business days." When I tried to get a refund for the unfulfilled delivery, I was met with an endless loop of automated bots and unhelpful agents who ended my calls. It felt like they hoped I'd just give up from pure frustration. This horrible customer service and their deceptive practices are why I felt compelled to share my story and engage with their customer service, however futile it seemed.
Customer: I need a refund for my $19.95 next-day delivery fee. Your website said "eligible for next day delivery," but then I got an email saying it would take 3 business days. That's not next day!
CS Rep: I understand your frustration, sir. I see you paid for expedited shipping on order [order number]. There might have been an unforeseen processing delay.
Customer: Unforeseen delay? I paid for a service, and you didn't provide it. I've tried calling, I've tried chat – no one helps! I just want my money back for a service I didn't receive.
CS Rep: I sincerely apologize for the miscommunication and the difficulty you experienced reaching us. Let me check your order details. I can process a full refund for the $19.95 shipping fee immediately. It should reflect in your account within 3-5 business days.
Customer: Thank you. That's the least you can do when you don't honor what you promise.
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

From Despair to Delight: Cinily.net Revived My Trust in Online Glasses! ✨

I've been absolutely loving my new glasses lately! They not only add a touch of chic sophistication to my everyday look but also provide incredible comfort and eye protection, especially during those long screen-time sessions. If you're ready to elevate your style while keeping your eyes safe, you definitely need to check out these amazing Ralferty Retro Cat Eye Glasses. Trust me, your eyes (and your wardrobe) will thank you!

I was absolutely fed up after my last online glasses purchase 😤. I paid $19.95 for "next day delivery," only to be told hours later it would take "3 business days." Trying to get a refund was a nightmare – endless automated bots and agents who just hung up on me. It felt like they wanted me to give up from sheer frustration. The whole experience left me incredibly disappointed and wary of buying anything online again 😭.
But I really needed new glasses, and after seeing some appealing styles on cinily.net, I decided to give online shopping one last try 🤔. I was hoping they could restore my faith in e-commerce.
And wow, did they deliver! As one customer perfectly put it, "Fantastic glasses! Both pair fit perfectly." ✨ I couldn't agree more. From the moment I browsed their site, the experience was smooth and easy. I found exactly what I was looking for, and the quality of my new frames is exceptional – they feel durable and look fantastic. I was especially pleased with their selection of stylish cat eye prescription glasses.
What truly set cinily.net apart was their clear communication and efficient service. There were no hidden surprises or deceptive practices. The shipping was prompt, and when I had a small question, their customer support was actually helpful and responsive, a stark contrast to my previous ordeal. It’s such a relief to find a company that values its customers and delivers on its promises. I’m genuinely happy with my purchase and grateful for such a positive experience! 😃
