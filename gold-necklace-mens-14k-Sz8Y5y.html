Many consumers seeking **affordable eyewear** often ask: **are cheap online glasses reliable**?

Lens quality is paramount for clear vision and the overall lifespan of your **economical eyeglasses**. Most **cheap prescription glasses** today come standard with essential coatings, including UV protection, anti-reflective properties, and scratch resistance.
