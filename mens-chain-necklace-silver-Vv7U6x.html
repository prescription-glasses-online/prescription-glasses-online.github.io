Next-Day Delivery Scam: Paid $19.95, Got 3 Days & No Refund! 😠

Let me tell you about my absolutely terrible online shopping experience, one that I hope serves as a cautionary tale for anyone considering this company. I thought I knew what "next day delivery" meant when their site explicitly stated my order was "eligible for next day delivery" and I paid the $19.95 fee. What I got instead was an email hours later saying my order would take "3 business days," completely contradicting what I paid for. It feels like a fraud, charging for services they do not provide. This blatant discrepancy and the lack of proper customer support compelled me to leave this review and try to engage with their customer service.
Customer: Hi, I paid an extra $19.95 for next-day delivery on my order but then received an email saying it would take 3 business days. This isn't what I paid for. I need that delivery fee refunded.
CS Rep: I understand your frustration with the delivery timeline. Let me check your order details for you. Some items may have production times that affect the delivery window, even with express shipping.
Customer: There's no production delay; these are Plano lenses with no prescription. Your site promised next-day delivery and charged me for it. I just want my $19.95 back, as the service wasn't provided.
CS Rep: I see. I apologize for the miscommunication regarding the delivery expectation. I will submit a request to our billing department for a review of your $19.95 delivery fee. They will assess the situation and process any eligible refunds.
Customer: Submit to the billing department? I paid for a service not rendered. It's not about "assessing," it's about a clear breach of what was offered. Can you just process it now?
CS Rep: My apologies, sir/ma'am. Direct refunds for shipping are handled by the billing department after a review. I've sent the request, and they will follow up with you. Is there anything else I can assist you with today regarding your order?
The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

From Online Shopping Nightmare to Eyewear Dream: Cinily.net Delivers! ✨

Speaking of finding those pieces that genuinely enhance your look and boost your confidence, I simply have to introduce you to something that has completely transformed my everyday style. These aren't just ordinary frames; they're the kind that instantly make you feel effortlessly chic and sophisticated. If you've been searching for that perfect blend of vintage charm and modern comfort, you'll understand why I'm raving about these incredible Retro Cat Eye Glasses for Women. They're truly a game-changer!

My last online shopping experience was an absolute nightmare 😤. I paid extra for "next-day delivery" for my Plano lenses, only to be told hours later it would take "3 business days." It felt like a complete fraud, and trying to get a refund for the unrendered service was like talking to a brick wall – automated bots and endless phone menus, with zero human help 😭. I swore I'd never trust an online eyewear store again.
However, my old glasses finally gave out, and after much hesitation and dread, I decided to give online shopping one last try, hoping for a different outcome 🤔. That's when I found cinily.net.
And what a difference it made! My experience with cinily.net was refreshingly positive. As one happy customer put it, "High quality and at such a good price. Met my needs. Great fit from the start."
From the moment I browsed their site, the process was incredibly smooth and user-friendly. Their selection of frames is fantastic, and the quality of the glasses truly exceeded my expectations. Unlike my previous ordeal, cinily.net delivered exactly what they promised. Their customer service was responsive and helpful, making the entire process stress-free ✨. It’s so reassuring to find a place where you can get genuinely best online prescription glasses without sacrificing quality or customer support. I'm genuinely thrilled with my new pair and will definitely be returning for future purchases. This is how online shopping should be! 😃
